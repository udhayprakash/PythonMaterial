type-casting is present in python 2.x only
    that too only for arithmetic operations

    1. If all the objects in arithmetic operation are of same type,
       the end results SHOULD be of the same data type.
    2. If one of them is different, the end result is higher data type among them.
				int < long < float


        0 < 0.2 < 1
        2 < 2.5 < 3
