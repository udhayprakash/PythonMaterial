# alarm_clock.py

# Description: A simple Python program to make the computer act 
# like an alarm clock. Start it running from the command line 
# with a command line argument specifying the duration in minutes 
# after which to sound the alarm. It will sleep for that long, 
# and then beep a few times. Use a duration of 0 to test the 
# alarm immediiately, e.g. for checking that the volume is okay.
