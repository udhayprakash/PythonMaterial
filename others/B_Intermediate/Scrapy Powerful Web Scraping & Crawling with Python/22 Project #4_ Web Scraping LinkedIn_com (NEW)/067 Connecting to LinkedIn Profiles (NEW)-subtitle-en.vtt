00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.100
Hey there! So this is our last video 
in the LinkedIn automation project.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.000
And, in this video, we will just click 
the Connect button, which is...

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.100
let's go back to the LinkedIn profile, 
which is going to be located here.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.500
And then we will type in here the Send now button. 
So, to do that, we can go to our Terminal.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.700
Let's close this, and also go back 
to our Terminal for the development.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:40.600
So, let's go back to our Inspect element, 
and we can see here that, let's see,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:50.500
&lt;span class="default-text"&gt;Connect&lt;/span 
Here, pretty much, what we will do is use

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.500
click open and closed parentheses with
the Selenium to click here to Connect.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.200
So, to do that, we can locate the 
Connect text first, which is going to be,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.700
as you can see, equal to the Connect. 
So, pretty much, selector is going to be

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.000
easy as selecting all of these spans, 
which have the Connect in them,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.500
which is going to be just this one element. 
So we go back to the Terminal,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.600
and then type in driver.find_ element_by_xpath() 
And then find every span.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.100
This is... this has to be done with the Selenium.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
It cannot be done with the Parsel 
selector or something like that.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.500
Clicking of the data, only scraping data,
we can do this with the other tools.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.000
Okay. So let's go back to our selectors. So select 
every span, and then in the square brackets, text,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.500
or that contains text, which is going 
to be equal to the Connect. Hit Enter.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.500
Let's go back to the Terminal. And here, 
as you can see, it's going to be located.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:07.000
So we can type in here click() 
And then here we've got our pop-up menu opened.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And if you click now here, Send now...  
and let's see. So it's located in the button,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and it contains Send now. So when it 
comes to this type of data points,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
it's going to be a bit trickier to locate it first. 
So it's probably going to be button-primary-large.ml3

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.660
So if we copy this, and paste 
this into our Inspection tool,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.230
we can see only one instance. So it 
seems like this is going to be the button,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.000
but I'm afraid that in the future, it will change. 
So if it does change make sure to update it.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Let's go back to the Terminal and type in... 
let's modify this previous statement

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.300
to select every class with the specific 
value that we just previously copied. And perfect.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.000
So our invitation to Andrea was sent.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Let's go back to the Terminal, and we can 
copy and paste this into our text editor.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So we can paste this in. And, let's see, 
so this is the latest statement. Sorry.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.800
We need to also go back to our 
Terminal and that first Connect.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:43.400
So copy and, let's see, paste this in here. Let's see 
if there's something else here that we need to add.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.600
So the only thing probably is just the
sleep function. We can type in here

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.500
sleep function of, really, three seconds. 
And also here, after our second click,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.500
we can sleep for also three seconds. 
We forgot to add here the click button.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.300
So we can copy this from here, and then paste it in,
and then save it. So this is not a finished script.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.300
What we need to do also here is
try and except. So we can type in here,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:24.960
try, and then except. I can just type in
here, pass. So let's also cut this,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.800
and paste this here, and prettify it or 
make it more readable, and save it.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:41.300
So why I'm actually using the try and except. The 
reason why is because if I run right now the script,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.500
it will load the specific person, 
and it will try to click here Connect.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.000
But since there is no Connect button, 
it will give us no such element exception,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
if you remember from our previous 
videos in this specific section.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.800
So it will give us that specific exception. 
So we can then go to the except,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.800
and then just pass it, because 
we are already connecting.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.000
Let's see if we saved it. We did. And let's 
go to the Desktop, and finally run it.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.500
We don't need to remove or delete our results_file.csv 
because it's in the write mode, so [wb].

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.500
Let's see, sublime text, as you can see here,
it's going to be in the write mode.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.000
If it was in append or something like that,
then it would be appended, really.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
But since it's going to be in the write mode,
it's only going to be removed,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.300
and then also auto-generated will 
be the, also, really, the empty file.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:59.200
So we open the Terminal, go to the Desktop, 
hit Enter, and then type in python script.py

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:14.000
Hit Enter, and let's just wait to see if 
this is... everything is working fine.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.700
I wouldn't... again, this was raised
previously, but I wouldn't go into

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:29.100
too much of scraping free on LinkedIn,
because it's going to be really restrictive

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.400
when it comes to scraping. So, let's see. 
So your, also, account can be easily banned,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:45.200
so make sure to not go again, or, 
really, to not send too much requests.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.500
As you can see here, we just scraped the data points. 
So we didn't click Connect on this person.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.119
We will click Connect. And, right
now, we'll click here this Send now button,

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:57.919
so as you can see, 
everything is working fine.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:07.000
So that will be it for this video. So to,
really, to make it more easier if you

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.360
want to scrape any other data points 
from LinkedIn, or if some data points

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.300
are not there or are missing, or are 
in any way or such form modified,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:26.000
and if you don't know the solution, make sure to go 
over to our Q and A Section and ask questions there.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.700
But, once again, I would highly suggest 
to not scrape LinkedIn too harshly,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:39.000
because you can get banned. And you, also, 
can really get restricted access to their site.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.319
So that will be it for the 
LinkedIn automation project.
