00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.200
Hey there! So in this video, or this section, 
we'll automate logging in first into LinkedIn,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.800
and then going into 10 or so different profiles 
and scraping some interesting data points.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.900
So let's begin right away. 
First, we need to open the Terminal.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.560
Let's maximize it, and let's start 
to build it. So we'll use ipython.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.949
And then the first thing that 
we will do is import Selenium.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:41.000
So from selenium import webdriver. Then
we will type in driver = webdriver.Chrome

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And then we will specify the path to ChromeDriver, 
which in my case, it's going to be this one.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So after we hit Enter, we will, 
as you can see, have a Chrome window.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.800
So then we will go linkedin.com, 
as you will see in a moment.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.500
So driver.get and then in either 
single or double quotes,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.000
you can type in https://www.linkedin.com

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.110
Hit Enter, and it will run it here, as you 
will see in a moment. The reason why we are

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.200
actually using Selenium is because
LinkedIn is JavaScript heavy,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.100
and it's almost impossible 
to scrape it, really, with Scrapy.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.800
And also it changes, really, sometimes on a 
weekly basis. So it's going to be a bit trickier

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.100
to do it with Scrapy. So Selenium is 
10 times better way. So as I saying

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.000
in the beginning of the video, 
we will automate logging in first,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.500
and we will populate some forms here, 
such as email and password.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.300
To do that, we go to the right
click, and then Inspect Element.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.300
Let's do something like this. And let's 
maximize this. Let's see, let's close this.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.500
And right now, we go to Inspect, 
and we'll see that we have now here

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.000
name="session_ key" and then class="login-email" 
So there are a few different ways of, actually,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.720
let's say, selecting the email. 
We can use either the name,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.920
which is going to have this value, 
or class, which is going to have this value.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.500
Let's go with the class. 
Selenium has their own selector,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.700
and it goes by driver.find_element, 
or elements, as you can see here.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.000
So if you need to find multiple elements, you 
then use find_elements. But if you want to use

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.200
just a single element, then you use 
find_element. So we need to now go to the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.800
find_element_ by_class_name, as you can see, 
because it's going to have this value, "login-email"

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.000
So we go find_element_by_class_name, and then

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.200
in open and closed parentheses, we type in,
pretty much, this value. So we can copy this,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.500
and paste this in, and then hit Enter. And, 
as you can see, it will redirect us to the page.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.900
This is totally normal. Then we go back 
to the Terminal, and as you can see, it's found.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.690
So then what we need to do 
is just type in, for example,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.100
username is equal to this value, and
then username.send_keys. So send keys,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.000
as you can see in a moment or so, it 
will populate keys that we input here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.900
So we can type in whatever email 
that we want. So let's say, for example,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.200
foo@gmail.com. Hit Enter. And, as you 
can see, it's populated here. So it's good to go.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.300
Let's go back to your text editor, 
and let's input some of the lines.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:13.500
So from selenium import webdriver is going to be
the first one. Select Python as the syntax.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.139
Let's go back to the Terminal,
and let's see. So driver is going to be

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:29.700
equal to this value, so we paste it in.
Then we go to the home page of LinkedIn.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.150
We also paste this. We can do
something like this. And then we find the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.400
username or email input, which 
is going to be this one. And then we type in

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.200
username.send_keys, for example, 
this email. The next thing is to locate...

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.400
let's go back. The next thing,
really, is to locate the password.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.000
So, really, the process is, really, 
the same, as you will see in a moment.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And, most of the time, it's 
going to be pretty straightforward.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.300
So you right-click, go to Inspect. And
then, as you can see, we have the type,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.000
name, class, ID, etc. So let's use, 
for example, right now, the ID,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
since the last time we used the class. 
So we can go back to our Terminal,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.400
type in driver.find_element. And then, as you 
can see... let's see where it is... find_element_by_id

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.900
So we can, pretty much, do this. And 
then also in open and closed parentheses,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.100
we can copy and paste this value. 
So id="login-password"

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.800
We go copy, and go back to the Terminal, 
and then we can paste this in. Hit Enter.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.500
And, as you can see, in a moment, it's going 
to be found here. And then we can, let's say,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:03.500
assign it to something like password 
is equal to this value. Let's copy this,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:11.900
and paste it into the Terminal. And then we
can write here, say, password.send_keys

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.729
So same thing, really, just like 
with the username or the email.

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:24.800
And then we can type in somepass, for
example. Copy this. Let's go back to the Terminal.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.539
And we can paste this in. After 
we hit Enter, you will see that

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.300
it's going to be populated here. The
password, of course, in asterisks.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.000
So, as you can see, it's working perfectly well. 
This is, by the way, just some dummy account,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.900
or dummy, really, information. So after 
we click here Inspect on the Sign in,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:52.600
because we want to click Sign In button, there's
multiple ways to be logged in when using Selenium.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.069
One thing also to note is that you 
can also, if the Sign in value changes,

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:02.600
that you can enter just Enter as a key.
So that's also a good thing to know.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.300
And also Selenium offers to send 
keys values. So some of them,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.400
such as Return or Enter were just previously 
discussed. But sometimes, for example, for scrolling in,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.400
then you can use Page Down or End, etc. 
So it's really a great thing to have sometimes.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.900
So let's go to Sign in, and let's see 
what values does it offer.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.500
So we have here the ID, as you can see, 
"login-submit", class, type.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:39.969
Let's use, for example, type. So we go to the... so 
we need to have type and submit. So let's see if,

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:50.500
actually, Selenium offers the type first.
So we go driver.find_element_by_

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.000
And, let's see, so does it contain type?
Nope, it doesn't contain type.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.439
But it contains by_xpath. So we can then 
write our custom XPath. So it's going to be

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:08.500
similar as with Scrapy. So we type in
driver.find_element_by_xpath,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:16.000
and then here we type in our XPath selector,
which is going to be double slash asterisk,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and then in square brackets, type is
going to be equal... let's go and see...

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.500
type is going to be equal to submit. So we
type here submit. And then hit Enter.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.500
Let's go back to the Terminal. Perfect. 
It's found. Also sometimes it's good to know

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.500
when doing debugging, for example, 
let's say we type in two times T, and hit Enter.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.000
As you can see here, we got the 
message NoSuchElementException.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.200
So this is a good thing to note, that 
not always, or really, when the value

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.200
with the Selenium is empty, then you 
will get the NoSuchElementException.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.900
So you will have to figure out the 
correct selector. So we type in submit.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:13.500
Okay, so it works. And let's type in, for example, 
sign_in_button is equal to this value,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:20.800
and copy and paste this 
into our preferred text editor.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:27.420
Paste it in. And then, finally, we will
click it. So the way that you click it,

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:35.800
it's going to be pretty straightforward.
So we type in sign_in_button.click() and that's it.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.800
This really mimics clicking 
on the button, so let's do that.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.000
And, as you can see, it changed. 
But, of course, since this is going to be

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.800
a dummy account, as you can see, 
it needed to reset your password, etc.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.900
But if it was a real account, then it 
would be working perfectly fine.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.200
So that will be it for this video. In the
very next one, we will continue

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.240
with the automating scraping LinkedIn.
