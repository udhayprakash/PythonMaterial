Hey there! So this is the third part of
our LinkedIn automation project.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.000
And in this specific part, we'll talk 
about how to create a Python file,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.700
which is going to be called parameters.py, 
which is going to have a variable name,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.800
such as search term, file name, and, 
really, linkedin username and passwords,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.200
which will simplify our main script.py file.  
So let's begin right away. So let's create it.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.800
Right click it on the Desktop. And then type in 
or, really, just create an empty document.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:43.600
Let's see. Let's rename it to parameters.py. 
Let's open it with the text editor,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.800
and then we can type in search_query,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.500
which is going to be equal to the... let's see, 
which is going to be, pretty much,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.000
equal to this one. So we can copy this, 
paste it in, and let's type in also file_name,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.510
which is going to be... we will enter our 
results from scraping profiles into CSV files.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:23.400
So we can type in results_file.csv. And
then we can enter our linkedin_username = ' '

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.900
And also linkedin_password is going 
to be equal to the single or double quotes.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.000
So here you will enter your email. 
And here you will enter your password.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.300
So if we go back to the script, the things 
that we need to import is first the parameters.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.500
So, really, it's... when it comes to Python,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.500
it's going to be easy as import 
parameters. That's it, really.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.900
So then here, we can, let's see, 
on the username.send_keys,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.000
you can type in parameters dot, and 
then use your linkedin_username.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.100
Copy and paste this. And then also 
for the password, same thing.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:18.200
So we are inheriting from the parameters 
module linkedin_password. Paste this in,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.720
and let's see if there is something else 
that we need to do. Let's also use here...

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.600
let's see, sleep functions. So we can 
use here sleeping for three seconds.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.300
So after inputting this, we can sleep for 0.5. 
So after inputting the search query,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.300
which is going to be equal to the 
parameters dot... let's see, search_query.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.900
So we can copy this, go back to our script, 
paste this in. And then after, really,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.900
pressing the Return or Enter key, 
we can type in for, let's say, 3 seconds.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.000
Here we can sleep for probably 0.5, 
but it's probably not needed.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.500
And let's see if there's something else. 
Yeah, I believe that's pretty much it.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.000
So let's see if this is actually going to work. Right now, 
I'll pause this video and enter my credentials here

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in the linkedin_username and 
linkedin_password variable names.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.600
Save the file, and also we can
right away save the script,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.400
and enter this into the Terminal. Okay, so 
username and password are entered,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.000
and I believe we can, pretty much, start the script. 
So we go to the Desktop, open the Terminal,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.500
navigate to the... let's zoom this in a little bit.
Navigate to the Desktop, so cd Desktop/

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.600
and then we can type in python script.py. 
Hit Enter, and let's see if this is going to be working.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.510
So it goes to linkedin.com. As you can see,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.670
it enters our credentials. 
It loads the page perfectly fine.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.500
And, let's see, now it should go to the... 
after sleeping in to google.com.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.600
And then entering our specific search query,
and loading the page. And it should be,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.500
pretty much, then, yeah, ended. 
Perfect.  So it works. The only thing, really,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.000
that we need to add here is 
the driver.quit. So driver.quit()

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And that's pretty much it. So here, 
or right now, we will go back to our...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.100
developing our automation tool. And 
we will do this in the very next video.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.380
So I'll see you there.
