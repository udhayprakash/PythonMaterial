00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:02,686
Hey there! So in this section of the video,

2
00:00:02,686 --> 00:00:05,677
we will write a more advanced spider.

3
00:00:05,677 --> 00:00:09,052
So we will re-use our previous code that we wrote

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,684
from the previous section.

5
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:14,851
And the new spider will iterate over the container

6
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:19,221
or quote containers and iterate over pages.

7
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:23,388
So there are currently ten or so different quotes

8
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,675
per page and around ten or so pages.

9
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:29,111
So hopefully we will, at the end of this spider

10
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,537
or this section we will have around

11
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:34,433
100 or so different quotes scraped.

12
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:37,843
From each and every quote we will scrape the text from it

13
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:40,436
the author and finally the tags.

14
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:42,066
So let's begin right away.

15
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:44,316
So if we go to the Terminal

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,096
and go to our, let's maximize this.

17
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:51,678
Go and copy and paste the URL.

18
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:56,255
So type in scrapy shell and then in single

19
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,838
or double quotes paste the URL.

20
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:01,465
We get...

21
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,826
Response status 200 which is successful

22
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:08,993
and we can pretty much start to write our selectors.

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,597
So we can remove the selectors previously that we wrote,

24
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,005
which is h1_tag and tags.

25
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:18,997
So we can comment this out for a moment,

26
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,997
so it doesn't interfere.

27
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,223
And let's begin straight away.

28
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:27,171
So the first thing that I would do in this type of case

29
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,019
is isolate quote containers.

30
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:33,719
Quote container is going to represent pretty much,

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,886
this will be first container, this will be the second one.

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,585
And this will for example, third one, et cetera.

33
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:43,256
So there are currently on the home page,

34
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:45,705
ten different quotes containers.

35
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,733
So to do that, like anything with the scraping of the data,

36
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,885
you should right-click, go to the Inspect,

37
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,989
and then as you can see pretty much

38
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,021
each and every &lt;div&gt; with the class of the value,

39
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,909
quote, is the container.

40
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,766
So as you can see, so here we have our ten containers,

41
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,666
so we will iterate over them.

42
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,299
Now how do we iterate over them?

43
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,466
Well we'll just use a simple for loop in our spider code.

44
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:15,520
And the XPath selection to get to the

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,738
first container is pretty simple.

46
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:22,905
So what we need to do is pretty much write the selector

47
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:26,038
or the similar selector that we wrote previously,

48
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:30,205
so we type in response.xpath, and then in parentheses,

49
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,468
and in either single or double quotes we will find

50
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:39,635
every class instance that has the value of the quote

51
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:41,153
as you can see.

52
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:44,546
So if we just type this in we will get

53
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:47,027
ten different selectors as you can see.

54
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:51,194
So this pretty much, selector corresponds to this one.

55
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:55,109
So the first container or in the site,

56
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,942
this pretty much HTML node.

57
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,557
So we are going to assign quotes.

58
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,433
To be equal to our previous statement.

59
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,774
Let's copy this to our code right away.

60
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:13,524
So copy and then paste it into your Text Editor.

61
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:19,121
So quotes, and we will iterate it pretty much for quote,

62
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:23,847
in quotes and then we will pass this for now.

63
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:28,274
Going back to our Terminal,

64
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,482
we will type in, let's type in quote

65
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:34,890
And the first quote is going to be

66
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,456
quotes or from the quotes

67
00:03:37,456 --> 00:03:40,278
and the first instance will be of course zero.

68
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:44,445
So quote is going to be pretty much this first container

69
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:49,520
from the site and if we're call in

70
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,791
quote.extract() and hit enter

71
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,041
you will see that this HTML

72
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,638
corresponds pretty much to this one.

73
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:02,739
So this is in the tree structure so more readable

74
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,906
but that's pretty much the same really

75
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:11,039
value really or the content of the page.

76
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,287
So that's going to be pretty much it for this video

77
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,079
in the very next one we will finally write

78
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,654
our three selectors so we will select the text, the author

79
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:21,023
and finally the tags.

80
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:22,335
So see you there.
