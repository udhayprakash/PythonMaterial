00:01.300 --> 00:07.690
So today we are going to learn how to scrape tables from the site the site that we are going to be using

1
00:07.820 --> 00:09.130
is this one.

2
00:09.400 --> 00:18.040
And this is sort of universal way or path with tips and tricks on how to successfully or more efficiently

3
00:18.130 --> 00:29.010
and easy scrape or parse the table data or table rows and then really the table data itself, or a.k. the values.

4
00:29.080 --> 00:30.190
So let's begin!

5
00:30.340 --> 00:37.660
So we go to the inspection tool to figure out how Firstly this table on the site is.

6
00:37.690 --> 00:40.480
really presented on this page.

7
00:40.510 --> 00:49.870
So here is the iframe as you can see HTML and all and most of the time really will encounter table

8
00:50.050 --> 00:55.790
notes and then in those table notes you will encounter table rows in the first table row.

9
00:55.960 --> 01:01.870
Most of the time of course will be the table header and then in that table header we will get the table

10
01:01.870 --> 01:03.490
data points.

11
01:03.490 --> 01:07.280
So this will be the first table data, and this will be the second table data.

12
01:07.300 --> 01:13.070
The third one and fourth one, etc.
So this side uses the divs and classes.

13
01:13.090 --> 01:13.480
Why?

14
01:13.480 --> 01:22.060
Because probably because it's really loaded in a matter of request and that request will be in the source.

15
01:22.090 --> 01:29.590
So if we try to parse this table from here from this specific yourself with Scrapy it will last forever

16
01:29.680 --> 01:31.280
because it's going to be long.

17
01:31.300 --> 01:43.420
So it's actually trying to do it to compete and go to the Terminal and then type in the shell and let's

18
01:43.510 --> 01:52.180
open it right away or see how exactly Scrapy sees it so we taken your response and it is going to be

19
01:52.180 --> 01:56.780
loaded right away for fear of if it's going to be over.

20
01:56.830 --> 01:58.950
Of course you just need to.

21
01:59.170 --> 02:03.580
Let's use the most easier solution.

22
02:03.580 --> 02:09.890
So I was thinking about writing some selector to select maybe just the team names or something like that.

23
02:09.940 --> 02:17.760
But you can go more easier by just typing in response.body, hit Enter, and then go to the site.

24
02:17.880 --> 02:22.600
Let's see for example copy and paste "Golden State".

25
02:22.820 --> 02:30.580
And then Find in your prompt and it's going to be located I'll see "Houston Rockets vs.

26
02:30.590 --> 02:30.950
Golden State".

27
02:30.950 --> 02:33.200
So this is not what we are looking for.

28
02:33.380 --> 02:38.020
And so trying to click once again fine you will see that they will not be caught.

29
02:38.060 --> 02:44.240
So this is the most easier way to figure out know the data is going to be in the Scrapy response.

30
02:44.240 --> 02:52.100
If it's not then there are some specific route to the server that Scrapy will not see it really.

31
02:52.610 --> 02:55.120
And that is why that's great.

32
02:55.400 --> 03:00.960
OK so let's copy and paste this URL to the table itself and open it.

33
03:02.520 --> 03:05.230
And you'll see the.

34
03:05.340 --> 03:09.030
It's going to be loaded without the rest of the page.

35
03:09.030 --> 03:18.460
So you can go to the Terminal and then "fetch" this specific URL, hit Enter, and then once again type in response.body

36
03:18.470 --> 03:23.790
hit Enter and then navigate to "Golden State", you can see here

37
03:23.850 --> 03:33.480
that is going to be loaded in the -as you can see here- class with the value "team" which is perfect so everything is fine.

38
03:33.980 --> 03:41.870
So once again as previously discussed try to show you sort of a universal way of how to parse

39
03:41.880 --> 03:48.260
the tables if you can for stripping tables and you don't know exactly.

40
03:48.380 --> 03:57.380
You always have our assistance in the Q&A section so make sure you get over there and ask any questions

41
03:57.410 --> 04:00.160
or really any concerns that you have.

42
04:00.210 --> 04:03.560
And I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

43
04:03.650 --> 04:13.220
So the idea once again is to make this as efficient as possible to do that when you encounter scripting

44
04:13.220 --> 04:15.130
or famous themselves.

45
04:15.260 --> 04:26.360
Always try to isolate us the main why we would like to do that is to further isolate the table data

46
04:26.440 --> 04:29.680
or generally data points that we like straight.

47
04:29.720 --> 04:37.800
So whenever we have maybe some conflict sites such for example go to the page on the first page.

48
04:37.810 --> 04:39.420
So for example this one.

49
04:39.470 --> 04:47.780
So if you maybe like to just grab the first let's say first call from the tables and then if you parse

50
04:47.780 --> 04:57.940
this page as it is and it works then it also selects this or really this year table data themselves.

51
04:57.950 --> 05:01.180
And of course you wouldn't really want to do that.

52
05:01.190 --> 05:10.520
So the idea here that I'm trying to get at is that whenever you encounter more complex or really larger

53
05:10.520 --> 05:19.130
sites or pages than sell make sure to isolate the page as much as possible really to make it more efficient

54
05:20.000 --> 05:21.290
and cleaner also.

55
05:21.500 --> 05:30.350
So I thought let's go to inspect and see how exactly we can get our table rose isolated.

56
05:30.720 --> 05:35.160
So we have here in class with the sites and then in it.

57
05:35.190 --> 05:39.950
But there is as you can see is iterating over them.

58
05:39.960 --> 05:43.440
They will select each row which is a good thing.

59
05:43.440 --> 05:51.690
And then we have the class and here the first one side side-over, side-fav, and then the second one side side-under.

60
05:51.780 --> 05:52.670
...

61
05:52.680 --> 05:59.940
So it seems like the only thing that is going to be changed to year for the first one and then every

62
05:59.940 --> 06:04.410
other one is going to be this year over again either.

63
06:04.470 --> 06:06.250
So we have a solution for that.

64
06:06.290 --> 06:13.450
All right sort of more complex selector or selector that will fetch two values as a walk.

65
06:13.500 --> 06:15.470
So let me show you how to do that.

66
06:15.500 --> 06:24.330
You can go to our text editor to make it more cleaner since here we have Python syntax highlighting and

67
06:24.340 --> 06:29.270
let's copy and paste this into our Terminal.

68
06:29.300 --> 06:31.770
Of course the selector itself is going to be fairly straightforward.

69
06:31.770 --> 06:43.950
So you're right we talk about at first and then we select every class and then we can pretty much just copy and paste this value

70
06:44.200 --> 06:55.450
and if we copy this and then paste it into our Terminal, hit Enter, you will see only one selector, which is good indeed.

71
06:55.870 --> 07:02.410
Then we if navigate back to the text editor, really the syntax it's going to be just one character

72
07:02.410 --> 07:09.820
or writing two or really few or doesn't really expand in this case, the selector and is going to be this

73
07:09.820 --> 07:10.780
character.

74
07:10.780 --> 07:16.890
So if we copy and paste this here this will work.

75
07:16.900 --> 07:23.640
So let me show you how or why it's going to be working.

76
07:23.760 --> 07:30.740
It's going to be working because we just put this sort of separator from the first one and then the

77
07:30.750 --> 07:33.450
second selector as teacher.

78
07:33.480 --> 07:38.990
So it's all going to be selected in the first instance watching and.

79
07:39.130 --> 07:46.640
We would like to also grab the other eight points or select first in this case to see where exactly

80
07:46.690 --> 07:49.500
when you go into your.

81
07:49.950 --> 07:57.560
And so it's going every other day lunch so if we copy and paste it here we can see it tonight and so

82
07:57.560 --> 08:02.620
on and all should and then 30 instances we did everything right.

83
08:03.490 --> 08:15.310
OK so we need to go and paste this new value to the row itself so you can use navigate back to the terminal

84
08:15.430 --> 08:16.660
and paste it in here.

85
08:16.690 --> 08:19.900
We should get a bunch of different selectors.

86
08:20.500 --> 08:22.540
So everything should be working.

87
08:22.870 --> 08:26.290
And let's call this verbal main roles.

88
08:27.370 --> 08:29.860
And then just to verify that everything's working.

89
08:29.900 --> 08:31.980
Should get in the blanks.

90
08:32.050 --> 08:35.120
We should get the mail you turned perfect.

91
08:35.140 --> 08:37.310
So also this works.

92
08:37.330 --> 08:42.940
So this again is just my way of thinking or really my workflow.

93
08:42.970 --> 08:50.920
Then the next step in my thinking is to further isolate neuros just like you for example roll and then

94
08:51.130 --> 08:52.890
you go to your office.

95
08:53.140 --> 08:57.940
And then just selecting the first instance or not right index.

96
08:58.060 --> 09:06.870
And then we call in Roths cracked open close branches and then pretty much we will write to our selectors

97
09:06.880 --> 09:08.060
from this role.

98
09:10.940 --> 09:19.400
So here we get the output or really ational lot south and you can see the class goals that.

99
09:19.470 --> 09:27.940
So if you like to extract the names or the first Calo from the table we need to type in row not that

100
09:28.360 --> 09:37.140
we want to use respons that's bad because we are in our custom written or developed really selector

101
09:38.180 --> 09:39.800
switch here.

102
09:39.870 --> 09:47.580
If we open this and close the parentheses then typing in the Singler about votes.

103
09:48.010 --> 09:59.460
If we died or if we exclude the dot and just typing to select every class we see with the team as in

104
09:59.490 --> 10:02.620
I will select everything.

105
10:02.740 --> 10:06.660
So what would like to do is just select the first one.

106
10:06.910 --> 10:13.870
So I believe this was previously discussed but just make sure that it's recent is on the same page.

107
10:13.870 --> 10:22.460
You need to also include that always when writing from the Custom Slipper's type.

108
10:22.710 --> 10:23.680
Now we do that.

109
10:23.680 --> 10:27.280
You can see the Golden State will be selected.

110
10:27.880 --> 10:30.700
And of course to select the text itself.

111
10:30.700 --> 10:37.070
You just need to type in text and then extracts and you get your data.

112
10:37.300 --> 10:43.960
So for selecting every other data point here you can write just another sample.

113
10:44.040 --> 10:54.100
First we go to the inspect and then see your class with the line book so you go quizzes and then let's

114
10:54.100 --> 11:01.450
go first to the Sublime Text and then type in course response.xpath or sorry row.xpath

115
11:02.040 --> 11:13.240
again always include a dot and then we need to select every class with the "line book" in it.

116
11:13.450 --> 11:20.970
And you can call this and then go to the Terminal and paste it in here.

117
11:21.220 --> 11:24.960
Time for an S Let's see what else we need.

118
11:25.030 --> 11:31.090
So we need to further isolate this so we need to go into learning books then.

119
11:31.200 --> 11:42.150
And then finally the value itself which is going to be located in spec so this should be fairly straightforward.

120
11:42.240 --> 11:49.610
Let's see if you go to atec and then strapper you Tanter and see here our data.

121
11:49.980 --> 11:54.470
It seems like the last one is not going to be in slogans.

122
11:54.720 --> 12:02.860
So I see that is the case of it so it seems like the last value as you can see is going to be

123
12:02.870 --> 12:03.350
-240

124
12:03.360 --> 12:09.900
However for me which is what you did here but the last value is going to be included.

125
12:10.520 --> 12:16.420
So what we need to do here is first inspect the elements and see what's up.

126
12:17.300 --> 12:24.410
And as you can see here in the "line book" we need to go into the a tag and then we get our data here.

127
12:24.740 --> 12:31.320
So we can't or we really need to go into just the tags and then span as previously.

128
12:31.820 --> 12:41.960
So what we need to do here is simply go into our tax shelter open this value as it is and then type

129
12:41.960 --> 12:49.130
in force sort of character for writing two or more different selectors and that basically means year

130
12:50.090 --> 12:54.940
and so the go to the terminal.

131
12:55.280 --> 12:58.300
We actually need to compare this.

132
12:58.400 --> 13:07.440
This is going to be easier to copy and paste.
Let's go to the text editor where we need to copy this.

133
13:07.450 --> 13:14.030
And so this should or is going to be going into a tag and span and then text.

134
13:14.350 --> 13:22.600
So if we paste it here right now another time and then exclude the a tag or sorry the span tag by deleting

135
13:22.600 --> 13:26.590
span element and finally copy and paste our data...

136
13:26.620 --> 13:30.630
we should be good to go and we should also select this value.

137
13:30.940 --> 13:32.800
So let's see this is going to work.

138
13:32.890 --> 13:39.650
So we can hear the temper and that's what we are missing here.

139
13:39.670 --> 13:48.420
Of course the abstract Tanter and truancy are sort of empty value appearing.

140
13:48.430 --> 13:51.740
So everything we know we're right to ask and see.

141
13:52.150 --> 13:54.010
So that would be a different issue though.

142
13:54.010 --> 14:00.550
Again this is just my way on when or how I approach when I encounter scrapin tales.

143
14:00.550 --> 14:07.150
And once again though normally really is going to be a bit more secure than stripping other data points

144
14:08.260 --> 14:09.520
from the site itself.

145
14:09.520 --> 14:14.980
So once again if you encounter any kind issues or if you have any further questions make sure to head

146
14:14.980 --> 14:19.810
over to our Q&amp;A section and then get back to you again as soon as I can.

147
14:19.810 --> 14:23.180
Thanks for watching this video and I'll see you in the very next video.
