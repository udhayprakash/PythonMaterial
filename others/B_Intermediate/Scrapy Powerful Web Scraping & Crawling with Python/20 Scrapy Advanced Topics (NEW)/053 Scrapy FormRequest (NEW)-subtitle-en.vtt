00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.730
Hey there! So today we are going to learn
how to populate forms such as this one

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.100
and scrape it on this specific page 
with using Scrapy FormRequest.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:21.800
FormRequests are most similar to the Request that 
we previously used. So if we open a new Terminal,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.420
then let's type in scrapy shell.
We can then import FormRequest

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.000
simply by going into the 
from scrapy.http import FormRequest. Hit Enter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.200
And FormRequest as the name 
indicates or prefix of the name is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.200
for the populating HTML forms such as this one. So if 
we click... or we need to first have the Stock Code.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.600
So let's use the first one, and then click Search. 
You will see that URL will not change

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.500
even though results or, really, 
the page was changed in the meantime.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.200
That means that we have
the POST request and, mainly,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.320
as you can see from the first page, we have 
here the form. So how we can then figure out

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.100
what exactly URL we are looking for is
to go to Inspect, then go to the Network tab,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.900
and, finally, to the All. Now if we 
click Search and wait for the requests

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.850
or, generally, page to get loaded, you 
will see a bunch of different requests,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.500
including most of them are images, as you
can see. Some of them are JavaScript pages,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.600
and here we got the aspx page. 
And as you can see from here,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.900
this pretty much corresponds to the page
that we would like to get. So if we click here,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.500
and go to the Headers tab, you can see 
in the General, Request URL will be

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.000
pretty much the same as this one. Then we have
here the Request Method is equal to the POST.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.500
So request methods are either 
GET or POST. If it was GET,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.500
then we would probably have something 
like this. So id=00001 if it was GET.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500
But since it's POST, then we will... 
or the URL really didn't change,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.200
and the parameters are located down below, here
in the Form Data, which we'll get into in a moment.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.800
So Request Method is once 
again POST. Status Code is 200.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.200
So everything is working fine. 
And then we go to the Form Data.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.800
So this is the, really, mainly, or the most 
important tab here in the Headers. So we can...

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.000
let's copy and paste this into our text 
editor so it's more... so it's more visible.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.600
So we can paste this here, and then 
Set Syntax to Python. And just to make sure

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.200
that we are on the right URL, you should 
always check the Response tab and see if the data

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.290
that you would like to grab is actually there. 
Okay? So let's go back to the text editor,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.590
and let's see. So here we got a bunch 
of different, really, keys and values,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.100
including the date, the day, month, year. As you 
can see, txtStockCode corresponds, pretty much.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.100
So if we go to the first page,
corresponds, really, to this Stock Code.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.100
And then the Enter or, really, the
value that we entered here is going to

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.300
be entered in this specific 
form data as we will populate it.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.300
So if we change it to 2, it will go to the
second symbol. And if we change,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.400
of course, the date, or the year, month, 
day, it will, of course, be changed also.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.200
We have then the first button, which corresponds
to the Search, and then the second one

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.100
is going to be Clear button. So the thing that 
we need to do here is to make the dictionary.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.510
So we need to... let's see how
we can do this most quickest.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:19.600
And let's try to automate adding
dictionary keys and values to,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.200
let's see, to everything here. So we are 
going to collect, yeah, this is going to be

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:36.400
time-consuming, and boring, also. So, let's
see, hopefully, we can do this more quicker.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.900
And let's see the first issue is that we
need to copy and paste these two here.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:52.400
And, let's see, so if we select every instance
here, put a space in it... no, it's not going to work

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.000
because we have to do it manually 
because some values are empty.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.500
Okay? And let's put curly brackets here.
And then for these three... these three are,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.700
by the way... let's see if we selected 
every one of them with it. Okay.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.200
So these three are VIEWSTATE, 
VIEWSTATEGENERATOR, and EVENTVALIDATION.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.500
On most sites, they will be listed out as a token.
So these are dynamic values that change.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.700
And if they do, then you can write simply
selectors for it. So if we copy and paste

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.600
this VIEWSTATE -- so go to Inspect, 
and then paste it in here -- then you can

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.700
pretty much extract it either by going in and
selecting all of the names with the VIEWSTATE,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.900
or all of the IDs with the VIEWSTATE. So, 
really, the XPath selector is extremely easy.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.400
And then you can type in
/@value, and then extract the first,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.300
really, value, which is going to be
corresponding to this specific value

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.500
that I'm highlighting right now. So it's
extremely easy. Sometimes some sites

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.500
do change their token or, really, the values
that you enter today will not work tomorrow,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.800
but some don't, really. 
Okay, so let's do this.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.800
And for the first value, let's finish it.
And then the only value that we are left with

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.800
is going to be the third one. Okay, so we 
should be good to go. We start with a bracket,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.700
and then type in, for example,
data is equal to the specific value.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:41.000
So we can copy this, and go to 
the Terminal, and then paste it in here,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and everything is working fine. 
And then, finally, we are going to have

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.600
the page variable name is equal to the FormRequest. 
And similar to the Request, you can enter

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.840
the first parameter to be URL. And the URL, 
you check the URL to the...  you go to the

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.200
Network tab, and then once you click 
the Search, you go to the specific URL.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.600
So in this case, this is our URL, and you 
get it from the Request URL. So you copy it,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:20.300
paste it from here. And then, finally, the
only other or the second parameter that

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.900
you need to use is called formdata.
And that will be equal to the data that

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.000
we have here with the dictionary keys 
and values. So, again, you can modify it,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.100
or probably even remove these empty 
values. If you want to modify, for example,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:44.100
let's use the first StockCode here. And so 
formdata=data. So we need to also

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:53.700
copy and paste this updated data
variable to have the first StockCode,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:02.000
so we can have some results. And then 
if we copy and paste this variable name,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:08.000
hit Enter, and then the final thing that
we need to do here is fetch the page.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.200
So to do that, of course, we go to the fetch, 
and then type in here page, hit Enter.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.080
And it should be loaded in around five 
to ten seconds. This, obviously, depends,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.800
really, on the page-to-page basis. 
And, right now, we are... so, let's see,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.000
we crawled 200 posts, as you can see, so it's not GET.
And the URL, pretty much, corresponds to this one.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.750
So it seems like everything is
working fine. So if we try to verify it,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:42.200
we go to the view(response), hit Enter. 
And this, of course, will load the page that

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.720
is returned from the Scrapy in the 
"tmp" or, really, local file. And we see that

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.900
Scrapy sees the results page, which
pretty much corresponds to the online one,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.010
or, really, the real one. So we
successfully made the FormRequest.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:03.410
FormRequests are, generally, quite 
a bit... I'm not going to say hard, but really

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:10.100
time-consuming to get it right. 
If you change even slightly,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.100
like something like this, right? 
You can't really even notice it,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.400
but you would not get the real results. 
So it's really time-consuming,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:27.700
so make sure to really approach it with, 
at least, half an hour or an hour, really,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:34.000
if you're approaching the first time. The 
reason why I use this specific site is because

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.100
it's a pretty basic one, and with slight
modification to the form or, really,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:46.579
the data variable and the URL here. So it
should be working on any other, really,

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:52.500
site that uses the FormRequest or
really POST requests on the site.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:58.209
So that will be it in this video, 
and I'll see you in the very next one.
