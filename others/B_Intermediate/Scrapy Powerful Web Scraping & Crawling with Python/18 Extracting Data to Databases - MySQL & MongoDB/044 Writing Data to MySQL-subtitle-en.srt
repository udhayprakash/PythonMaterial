00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,790
Hi, so in this video we will write data to MySQL database.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,850
The data that we are going to write is going to be
in the CSV file first, so we will reuse the Spider

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,500
that we already wrote previously.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,090
Let's go to the books.py file
and modify first code.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:29,430
So what needs to be done is just to comment out these three lines
so this is the logic for going to the next

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:38,850
page URL and then extracting thousand or so page URLs,
book specific URLs. So this

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,730
if I remember correctly there are 50 pages
so this one will actually just go to the let's see the start_urls

8
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,840
is going to be the home page so books.toscrape.com
and the spider will just iterate

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,030
over books.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,230
There should be, this books

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:02,160
variable should contain list of 20 book URLs
and we will yield request to the parse_book which

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,900
is going to yield all of these
different pretty much data points.

13
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,140
Pretty simple so there should be
item_scraped_count should be twenty.

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,880
So let's actually verify that.

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,040
So we type in "scrapy crawl books".
and let's see I think we haven't saved it.

16
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,920
That's correct and we see here

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,170
item_scraped_count is twenty which is perfect.

18
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,490
There is not a single error which is great also.

19
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,490
So everything is working correctly and fine.

20
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,740
So let's go back to the code.

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,480
There are few other modifications that needs to be added.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,310
So the first one is going to be that we
are going to import few different modules.

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:52,750
The first one is going to be "os" or operating system,
the second one will be for example "csv" since

24
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,490
we are going to read from the csv
to output to the MySQL database.

25
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:08,200
"import glob" which is going to be reused or used
for locating the latest defined CSV file and finally

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:19,240
we will "import MySQLdb".
The way that you actually install MySQL database in Python is,

27
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,190
you can type in pretty much "sudo pip install"

28
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,320
"mysql"

29
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:32,090
"-python", hit Enter, we will enter the password
and this is already installed on my end.

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,250
So let's see.

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:45,200
This is for using MySQL database
or connecting it to the Python code so it can be then transferred

32
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,770
straight to the database.

33
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,940
And here is the Requirement is already satisfied.

34
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,400
Perfect.

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,220
Let's see what else, so rather than grabbing, let's see

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,170
how many, 12 lines or 12 items let's just add

37
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,740
few of them.

38
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,360
So let's add the title.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:15,370
Let's leave that also let's keep the rating
and let's see what else we can use we can use upc.

40
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,170
And also let's use product_type.

41
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:26,360
Everything else we can delete, just to make it easier
and let's just verify that everything is working

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,850
correctly.

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,730
Okay, 20, perfect. So everything is working great.

44
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:41,280
What needs to be added right now is
our close function so "def close" and then the

45
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,240
well-known parameter.

46
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,110
The first one is of course "self".

47
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,850
The second one is "reason", we already covered this.

48
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,310
And here we are going to get the CSV file,
and we are going to reuse the code that we already wrote and

49
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,260
explained in previous video.

50
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:07,640
So let's actually just type this in, so "*.csv"

51
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:23,070
And the "key=os.path.getctime",
and let's actually print it out and

52
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,020
let's save it. We will have to define output so "-o"

53
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,610
and then for example "items.csv",
and let's see what is not working.

54
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,340
It's not in the strings

55
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,800
Okay so it printed out

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,990
items.csv which

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,720
is perfect.

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,740
Let's remove it right now.

59
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,720
Let's see.

60
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,390
If it's removed, it's removed.

61
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:54,000
And the way that you actually remove it is with the "rm"
and then you can define or remove

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,850
scrapy.cfg.

63
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,120
Let's not do that.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
And yeah.

65
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,980
So let's go ahead
and define our second line of code in this function close.

66
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:14,080
And that will be "mydb",
and it will inherit from the "MySQLdb"
and will use the "connect".

67
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,750
The few parameters that we are going to assign
is the first one is going to be the "host", host is

68
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,040
going to be "localhost".

69
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:35,620
So just type in localhost and then go here,
then what we need to define is "user" and that will be "root"

70
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,500
so the root is the same one as in the.

71
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,170
So if we go into "mysql"
and then define "-u root".

72
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,530
This is the same user.

73
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,750
And then let's actually just go once we are here.

74
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:58,750
Just go to welcome screen to the MySQL
and move it to the next screen.

75
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,130
Okay perfect, and what else.

76
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,090
So what needs to be added is the password also.

77
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:18,210
So the "pass" is going to be the argument type or the name,
sorry the "passwd" is going to be

78
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,070
the argument name
and the password that I used is just "foo".

79
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,850
This will differ on your end.

80
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,510
And let's see what else "db" is going to be called.

81
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,770
Let's call it "books_db".

82
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,090
Let's actually go back to the MySQL
and then see or show databases.

83
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,420
Okay perfect.

84
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,300
It seems like we haven't defined it yet.

85
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,760
So let's actually create database, so to do that

86
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:57,560
we of course type in "CREATE DATABASE books_db".

87
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,870
And then let us use it, so "USE books_db",
database changed, perfect.

88
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,930
Let's go back to our code
and let's see, this is done.

89
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:20,960
And the last thing that needs to be done here is
the "cursor" variable and that is going to be my "mydb".

90
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,700
And then we are just going to assign or put ".cursor" in it.

91
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:38,370
And "csv_data" is going to be variable name for
the "csv.reader" that is going to be from the CSV file.

92
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,290
So this file,
and we will start to iterate over this file.

93
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,300
So one row of data or one row by one row.

94
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:58,350
This is because we are going to be, let's see.
We are going to have the items.csv number,

95
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:05,690
and we are going to be having this four different column names
and we are going to iterate over each row

96
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,920
and grab pretty much each
and every value
and put it into MySQL database.

97
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:20,150
We have to of course create table with
these four column names and then assign the values

98
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,550
in our Python code.

99
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,720
So we will in the very next few lines we will do that.

100
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,880
So the first thing that needs to be done is that
we have to assign "row_count = 0", because we will

101
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,370
add a counter
and then we finally put the for loop.

102
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,290
So this for loop will iterate over
each row from the CSV data.

103
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:52,770
So from this variable or the CSV file,
and "if row_count" first and foremost is

104
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,770
"!=0".

105
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,060
We will execute.

106
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:10,080
So we will actually at least for now pass it,
and we will then use "row_count"

107
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,060
"+= 1"

108
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,900
And finally we will, after this is all done.

109
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,610
We will close out the connection to the database.

110
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:30,930
To do that we type in "mydb.commit()"
and then "cursor.close()".

111
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,370
Let's see.

112
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,220
And finally, that will pretty much be it.

113
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:43,320
So this is the most important line that we are going to write
and it's going to write the data one row

114
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:56,730
by one into our MySQL database. So the cursor is going to execute,
and it's going to be or this parenthesis

115
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:08,660
is going to be pretty much
the same syntax that we would use in our

116
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,140
MySQL shell,

117
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,390
so right here.

118
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:19,020
So what we need to type in is "INSERT IGNORE INTO books_table"

119
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:29,370
for example can be the table name in our books database
so we also need to create that, the way that we create that is

120
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,790
by actually let's see the items.csv.

121
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,600
So the first variable names are going to be rating then:
product_type, upc and title.

122
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,130
OK so let's see.

123
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:49,670
So we are going to create table, "CREATE TABLE",
and then the table name is.

124
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,550
Let's see "books_table".

125
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,570
Let's see if we need to do anything else,
we need to assign our variable names.

126
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,600
The first one is going to be let's see the rating.

127
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,950
So "rating" is going to be

128
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,830
"VARCHAR(20)".

129
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,020
Also MySQL has the digits and stuff like that.

130
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:28,660
We are not going to cover this
because it takes a lot of time but these are the most specific or really

131
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:36,720
the most well-known type of the variable names
that exist in the MySQL db and they are flexible

132
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,490
so that's why we are using it.

133
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,750
Let's see the "product_type" is going to be the same type.

134
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,720
And finally we have upc and title.

135
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,880
so "upc" and "title".

136
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:08,840
And we are going to close our parenthesis
and just put the ";" and this should work, OK perfect.

137
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:18,350
So we will "SELECT * FROM books_table",
just to see if there is empty set which there should be,

138
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,950
perfect empty set.

139
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,620
So everything is working correctly and fine.

140
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,380
Let's delete the CSV file.

141
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,840
And let's go back to our code.

142
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,270
So INSERT IGNORE INTO BOOKS TABLE
and then what we need to add is the parentheses once again.

143
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,280
And then I add the the title.

144
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,730
Sorry no the title

145
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,220
but the rating.

146
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:58,140
So rating, product_type, "rating, product_type",
and let's see "upc, title".

147
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,800
And what needs to also be added is "VALUES".

148
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,690
So these are going to be the values
that we put into each and every time.

149
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,250
So these are all going to be strings.

150
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,070
So we will put, let's see.

151
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,780
This is for the value for the rating.

152
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,250
This is for the product_type.

153
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,560
And here we also have two others.

154
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,260
This is for the upc
and also for the title.

155
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,950
Finally let's just verify that it's right, product_type.

156
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,030
And the first one is rating. So everything is great.

157
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,910
And what needs to be added is, is this line.

158
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,240
Finally the, let's see

159
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,450
single quotes.

160
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,190
And once I have here single quotes I don't need any more.

161
00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:01,640
And then just write the "row",
because we are going to extract from the CSV file or CSV row.

162
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,150
And that should pretty much be it.

163
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,120
So let's actually save it
and see if it's working.

164
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:14,160
So "scrapy crawl books" and then "-o items.csv",
and seems like it's working.

165
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:20,340
Let's see the CSV file is in the correct order,
so: rating, product_type, upc, title.

166
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,040
Perfect.

167
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:29,430
Let's go to our my MySQL shell and let's select once again,
it should contain 20 rows of data, perfect.

168
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,030
So we have here:

169
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,810
rating, product_type, also the upc and the title.
And that would be it for this video.

170
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,640
Thanks for watching!
