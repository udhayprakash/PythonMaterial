00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Hey there! So today we are going to learn how 
to download images locally to your file system.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.100
So the only thing that we need to install,
 of course, if you don't already have it,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.089
is a tool called Pillow. So if 
you don't already have it,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:26.500
navigate to your Terminal or Command Prompt, 
and then type in sudo or just pip install Pillow.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.300
Hit Enter. And then, of course, if 
prompted for the password,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
make sure to enter it, and then once again 
hit Enter. And since I already have it,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.700
I get the message that requirement is 
already satisfied. We can close the Terminal now,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.210
and go to the Course Content page for 
this course, and then go to the section.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.600
Let's see, Section 14 called Scrapy 
Spider - Books Store. So if we click it,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.700
we are then going to download the 
already written or already developed spider

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.000
called Advanced_spider_books_2.zip. 
So since I've already done that,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.500
I can go to the Desktop, and then
extract or unzip the source code,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.400
and then go to the root directory. And let's
see what exactly firstly this spider does.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.200
Then go to the spiders and, of course, just  
make sure to open it with your preferred text editor.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Okay. So let's see. So we are going 
into the books.toscrape.com page.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.100
And then we are iterating over the books 
and processing the next pages.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.000
So iterating over pages of the results. And then 
we are grabbing from each and every book.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We are grabbing a bunch 
of different data points.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.400
We can remove most of them. So let's see. 
We can, pretty much, remove all of these

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.300
different data points, and then just leave 
the title, for example, price, image_url, also.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.500
So we can also remove this method, 
since we are not referencing it anywhere.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.800
And then let's talk about... so we are talking about

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.000
just grabbing the title prices, and
also then just the image_url.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.200
So we can save this spider code 
as it is, and then go to the folder,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:28.000
and finally go to the items.py file. So the tool that 
we are going to use in Scrapy is called Images Pipeline.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's part of the media pipeline that Scrapy offers.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.400
And after you finish watching this video, 
make sure to just give it a read

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.000
on the latest Scrapy official documentation. 
It's really exceptionally well written.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.650
And so you just need to make sure to really
know the full extension of this pipeline

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.600
because it's really powerful. And when it
comes to dealing with the images,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.740
you can make sure to maybe add something 
like making sure that dimensions are, at least,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.090
like 100 times 100, or that are... that they
are, indeed, some specific name form,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.000
or a bunch of, really, other stuff that I'm
not going to get into, but it's really good.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.300
So make sure to give it a read. Okay.
So the thing that we need to add here is...

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.100
let's go to the spiders folder, and we
can... let's just copy and paste these two.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.200
I'm not going to paste this one as I
will explain in a moment why I didn't do this.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.400
So we can paste this 
in here, so title and price.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.300
And then we will add the two default 
variable names that media, or better said,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.300
Images Pipeline offers. The first one is called 
image_urls, and it's for the image URLs, obviously.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.840
The second one is the images
field for the... the images field is

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.300
really for the information about the
the downloaded images, as you will see

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.900
after we run the crawl command. 
And then the only thing, of course,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.300
that we need to do is call in:  = scrapy.Field()

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:25.300
And then we can save this. And, finally, close it. 
So let's go to the folder, and go to the settings.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.500
Now settings will also need to be 
modified, and we will add another line,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:38.300
and just modify one line. So ROBOTSTXT_OBEY is 
set to false. And we need to modify ITEM_PIPELINES.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.840
So we can uncomment this.
And then instead of referencing some...

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.300
as you can see, books_crawler.pipelines, 
so this will actually go to the pipelines.py file.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.900
And this is for our... some custom 
pipeline that we are going to write.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.000
We are just going to reference 
the Scrapy already enabled or, really,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.200
developed pipeline called 
scrapy.pipelines.images.ImagesPipeline.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.500
So this is, again, just a pipeline 
that Scrapy by default offers it,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500
and that we will use 
for downloading locally images.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.290
We can set it to 1, and 
then we add just the line called

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:33.600
IMAGES_STORE is equal to and then some
paths, for example, that will go to the home,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.400
then your username, then, for example,
Desktop, and then the name of a folder.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.900
It can be something like foobar. So this 
will go to the, pretty much, this folder,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:52.479
as I'm going to write it or define it here. 
And then it will download there the images.

00:05:52.479 --> 00:06:00.000
We can save this, then close it. And then, finally,
let's see if we need to add anything else here.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.020
Pipelines, we don't need 
to change anything.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:09.300
So what's only left to modify is the
books.py or, really, our spider code.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.600
There are going to be two imports.
The first one is for the item loader.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.800
So type in from scrapy.loader import ItemLoader.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:35.000
And the second one is for the locally items.py file. 
So we type in from books_crawler.items import

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.700
And let's see how the items.py class 
is defined. So let's call in BooksCrawlerItem.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.300
So if we copy this and paste it 
in here, we are going to be good to go

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.500
when it comes to importing. So this
once again goes to the books_crawler.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.300
So, really, this folder that I'm referencing
right now. And then goes to the .items

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.600
or items.py, and then it reads from the already

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:10.050
or just previously mentioned BooksCrawlerItem. 
Here we only need to add a few more lines.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:16.600
The first one is for the item loader. 
So type in l = ItemLoader.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.500
And then in the open and closed 
parentheses, type in the first parameter,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:28.900
which is called item=BooksCrawlerItem, 
so we can do this,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:35.100
and then make sure to call it in like this. 
And then call in the second parameter,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:42.000
which is called response. And then, 
of course, that will be equal to response.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.800
Let's see, for example, we can just make 
sure to call this the images or image_urls.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:59.000
So to make sure that we are going to be, 
or that variable name is going to be the same as

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.900
the Image Pipeline default, 
like this one. And then, let's see,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:13.100
we need just to add a few more 
lines. So we call in l.add_value

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:19.500
and then we can write quotes, 
something like this. And then copy this line,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:26.600
and paste it here. Oops, sorry. 
Copy this and then paste it below,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:33.300
and then paste it once again. 
And then, finally, call in the return l.load...

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:39.700
Okay, so we have to write it, load_item, 
 open and close parentheses here.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.600
We are going to copy and paste 
these two. So title and prices.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.600
So we can type here, paste it in here, 
and then also paste it here.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.000
And then call in the image_urls. So
we can copy this line, and then,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
pretty much, paste it also here. 
So pretty straightforward.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.800
And if we save this, and then go back to
the root directory, we are going to be good to go.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.400
Let's see how the spider 
is called. It's called books.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:13.400
So if we go to the root directory, 
and then open again your Terminal 
or Command Prompt...

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.800
it depends really what you use.  
And then we can run it, finally.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:26.500
So we call in scrapy crawl books,
and then just hit Enter.
And as you can see here,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:33.200
we are going to scrape a lot of pages, 
so let's just end it. And, as you can see here,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.000
we got the image_urls, images. And then, 
as you can see, this is for the information

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
about the downloaded images. And then, 
finally, the price and the titles, of course.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.700
Now if we go to the foobar, or our defined 
folder for the images that are downloaded,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.500
we will see the new folder called "full."  
Then if we go to it, you will see the images

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:05.640
that are generated or downloaded
locally. So that will be it for this video,

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.740
and I'll see you in the very next one.
