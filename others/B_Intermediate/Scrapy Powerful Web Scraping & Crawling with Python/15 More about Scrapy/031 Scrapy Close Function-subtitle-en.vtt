Hi there! So today we are going to learn
more about Scrapy close function.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.020
This function is executed

00:06.030 --> 00:12.780
once the Spider is completed scraping
so you can use it to analyze data, send the data file via e-mail

00:12.780 --> 00:20.960
or just receive SMS message as a status
if it's completed successfully or not

00:21.110 --> 00:21.530
or something completely else.

00:21.570 --> 00:28.020
In this video we will concentrate on just renaming the CSV file
that is getting generated, the code that

00:28.050 --> 00:34.030
we are going to use or simply put reuse
is going to be from our last video.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.650
So we will need to do two things.

00:36.690 --> 00:42.750
And the first one is that we need to "import os",
and then "import glob" module.

00:42.840 --> 00:48.390
And the second thing that we need to do of course
is define the function which is going to be called

00:48.390 --> 00:52.670
"close" and the two arguments 
that we are going to use is "self"

00:52.680 --> 01:02.400
and then "reason". Then we need to, for example type in "csv_file"
which is going to be variable name with the

01:02.790 --> 01:05.330
string as a file name.

01:05.340 --> 01:12.850
So for example the filename 
that we are going to use is going to be "-o".

01:12.950 --> 01:23.160
And then define "items.csv" for example,
so CSV file in the end will be "items.csv" as a string

01:23.210 --> 01:24.950
pretty much.

01:24.950 --> 01:32.820
So to calculate the latest CSV file that
is getting generated in the root directory.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.380
What we need to do is type in "max(glob)"

01:37.610 --> 01:41.270
And then we can use "iglob" from the glob module.

01:41.510 --> 01:47.100
And here we can then extract
or get every .csv file in the path.

01:47.150 --> 01:56.990
And the key is going to be "os.path.getctime"
which is again pretty much going to get us the

01:56.990 --> 02:01.110
items.csv as a string in a csv file.

02:01.130 --> 02:11.000
And then if we just type in "os.rename(csv_file),"
with something like for example "foobar.csv".

02:11.000 --> 02:15.070
And then save it, go to the code and simply Run it.

02:15.110 --> 02:23.080
And as you will see the items.csv
or the csv feed is stored in the items.csv.

02:23.110 --> 02:30.940
But if we go to the root directory you will see that
the file with the foobar in it as a CSV file is getting

02:30.940 --> 02:31.540
generated.

02:31.540 --> 02:34.210
So it seems like everything is working correctly.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.250
And that'll be it for this video.

02:36.250 --> 02:43.990
Again this is just a short intro on
how you can use close function
and I'll see you...

02:43.990 --> 02:44.700
in the very next video.
