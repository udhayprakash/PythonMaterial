00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:01,400
Hey there!

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,501
So today we will cover running Scrapy Spider

3
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:05,726
with the runspider command.

4
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:08,952
Normally we would navigate to root directory of our project,

5
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:12,563
and then you would, from here use Scrapy Crawl command

6
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:14,230
with the runspider.

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,638
We can run it similar to pretty much

8
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:18,641
how we would run the Python script,

9
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:22,147
so pretty much without having to create a project.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,147
If you need quick Spider for some short and quick job,

11
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:28,258
then runspider has a lot less boiler plate

12
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:29,908
that is required.

13
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:33,150
For now, let's actually just copy and paste this code,

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,733
and open it in the Text Editor.

15
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,727
And let's clean it up a little bit.

16
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:42,810
So, this is fine, this we don't need,

17
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:47,166
also these other two imports we don't need,

18
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:50,833
and also we don't need opening, ItemLoaders,

19
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:56,645
and finally, we don't need these trailing three lines.

20
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,867
We can just print out the h1_tag.

21
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:05,800
And finally, print out the tags, and that will be fine,

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,967
so let's save it, and run back to our Desktop,

23
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,814
Open in Terminal, change the directory to the Desktop,

24
00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:16,897
and finally let's run our new Spider.

25
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:21,181
To run it type in,

26
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:25,392
scrapy runspide quotes.py

27
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:29,246
And, as you can see, it's similar,

28
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:31,582
or the output is pretty much exact

29
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:34,673
as the scrapy crawl command,

30
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,960
which pretty much means that

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,362
really scraping would be done the same way,

32
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:43,061
and once again, you would use runspider command

33
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,669
for some quick and dirty, so to speak, jobs.
