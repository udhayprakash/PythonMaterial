Maximum Password Length 
-----------------------
"bcrypt algorithm only handles passwords up to 72 characters, any characters beyond that are ignored. 
To work around this, a common approach is to hash a password with a cryptographic hash (such as sha256) 
and then base64 encode it to prevent NULL byte problems before hashing the result with bcrypt"
