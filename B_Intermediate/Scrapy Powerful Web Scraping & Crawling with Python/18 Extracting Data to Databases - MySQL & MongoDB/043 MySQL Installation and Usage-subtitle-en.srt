00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,770
Hey there!
So today we are going to learn about MySQL.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,090
It's one of the most popular database,
mainly because of its ease of use.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,070
It's also open source
and it's scalable and flexible on top of that.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,870
So let's go ahead
and install it first on Linux.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,900
Process is really straightforward and you just need to
enter the following command in Terminal so you

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,230
can type in "sudo apt-get install mysql-server",
hit Enter.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,980
And since I already have it installed,
I will not install it right now but if I didn't have it installed

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,450
then pretty much the process would be
for you just to enter the password.

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,960
That will be reused once you
access the my MySQL shell.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,700
So it's really straightforward
and it should be done in a minute or so.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,820
Now how to actually access the MySQL shell.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,820
Well, once you've have MySQL installed,
you can access the shell by typing in the following command

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,280
into Terminal so you can type in

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,380
"mysql -u",

15
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,810
which stands for username.

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,830
Then the username would be "root".

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,880
And then "-p",

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,870
which stands for password.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,280
After that we type in password that
we inputed first time that we installed MySQL server

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,880
and hit Enter.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,110
After that we will get the welcome screen
and the first thing that we would for example want to do is

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,190
just to see the databases currently.

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,220
To do that we can type in "SHOW DATABASES;"

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,240
like this.

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,280
And most if not all of the MySQL commands
are going to end with a semicolon.

26
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:47,950
So just remember that and hit Enter
and as you can see here we have four different databases.

27
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,020
If you don't put the semicolon you will see that
you will not get or receive an error

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:03,550
or you will receive another error or arrow really
that will pretty much go to the second line.

29
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,380
So if you inputed right now the semicolon you will be fine.

30
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,580
Let's actually quit it for now, so to do that

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:19,510
you can just type in "quit" like this or "QUIT",
and you don't need to for some reason enter

32
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,760
the semicolon with this command.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,290
And let's actually sign in once again
and let's create some database so to do that we can type

34
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:37,600
"CREATE DATABASE sample_db;"

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,820
If we once again type in "SHOW DATABASES;"
we will see that right now we have five different databases

36
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,190
and the last one that we have added is
"sample_db" right here.

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
So that's all good.

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:02,470
And to create a table which will have its name
which can be for example table example and we will enter

39
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,310
some fields in it.

40
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:12,220
So to do that you can type in "create TABLE table_example("

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,300
and hit Enter.

42
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,820
And here we will input one field or one by one field.

43
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:27,190
So the first one can be since this is just a sample,
let's have "first_name" and then that variable

44
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:37,450
name will have "20" or so maximum characters,
the "last_name" for example can also have the same number

45
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,560
of maximum characters.

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,640
The "gender" for example can be just character
and it will only be "1" for example.

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,750
So the value will be "M" or female as

48
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,110
"F".

49
00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:00,040
And let's put ",", and the last item can be
or the field can be "birthday" for example.

50
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,790
So let's type that in
and that will be specifically "DATE".

51
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:11,720
So as you can see MySQL has different kind of
characters and let's put the ")".

52
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,190
And finally the ";".

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,430
Let's see what we had.

54
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,040
We had ERROR, No database selected.

55
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,870
Okay perfect.

56
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,280
So we have an error.

57
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:28,840
The reason why is because we are still sort of in the home page,
we have to actually navigate to the

58
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,800
"sample_db", so do that we can type in "USE sample_db"

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,250
And as you can see we get the message that
the database is changed which is perfect.

60
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,660
So if we type in once again the creation of the table
and then input some variable names and

61
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:56,970
hit Enter we will see that query is OK
and that 0 rows are affected as of right now which is perfect.

62
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:04,300
So to actually see our table we can just go ahead
and type in "SELECT *" which is going to select

63
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,320
all or everything.

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,840
"FROM table_example"

65
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,320
So this will once again show the content of the table.

66
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,970
Let's see, it's empty set which is perfect.

67
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:23,630
So what we need to do is actually insert some fields
or values into the fields to do that.

68
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,870
We type in "INSERT INTO table_example(".

69
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:36,190
And then we'll type in the fields
that we would like to be affected.

70
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:49,120
So the fields are "first_name", "last_name",
also "gender" and then the "birthday" and ")".

71
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:57,200
And also another thing that has to be added is VALUES,
so the values will be "(" and

72
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,560
then we can type in.

73
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:07,460
Sort of like in Python strings so we can type in then
"Mark" which will be value for the first_name for

74
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,560
the last_name the value can be

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:18,170
for example "Smith", the gender in this case will be "M"
and the birthday can be

76
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,560
for example let's say type in "1990-01-01"

77
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,250
or really anything it doesn't really matter, let's close

78
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:39,500
the parenthesis and type in ";",
and here we see another message so Query is OK.

79
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,140
And 1 row is affected.

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
So that's a good thing.

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,420
If you remember we had that Query is OK
and that 0 rows are affected.

82
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:58,450
So right now if we type in, give me a moment,
to view the table example we should get one row of data with

83
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,620
these values.

84
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,990
So let's see that and ";" of course.

85
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,690
And perfect.

86
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:13,240
So we have: first_name, last_name, gender and a birthday,
and to delete the table or to delete the values

87
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:21,990
you can type in the command
that goes "TRUNCATE TABLE table_example".

88
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,840
And then put the ";".

89
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,710
And right now if we go ahead and type in
the previous command we will not get any results.

90
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:39,690
As you can see it's empty set which is perfect
and to delete database we can type in

91
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,740
"DROP DATABASE sample_db;".

92
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,140
And if we type in to show databases, we will not see any more

93
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,940
our sample_db, so type in "SHOW DATABASES;".

94
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,380
And as you can see only four databases are shown.

95
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,110
And would be pretty much it for this video,
in the very next video we will learn how to write data that

96
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,700
is scraped to the MySQL db
and I'll see you there.
