00:00.170 --> 00:04.790
Hi, so in this video we will write data to MySQL database.

00:04.980 --> 00:11.850
The data that we are going to write is going to be
in the CSV file first, so we will reuse the Spider

00:11.850 --> 00:14.500
that we already wrote previously.

00:15.210 --> 00:20.090
Let's go to the books.py file
and modify first code.

00:20.220 --> 00:29.430
So what needs to be done is just to comment out these three lines
so this is the logic for going to the next

00:29.430 --> 00:38.850
page URL and then extracting thousand or so page URLs,
book specific URLs. So this

00:39.090 --> 00:45.730
if I remember correctly there are 50 pages
so this one will actually just go to the let's see the start_urls

00:45.730 --> 00:51.840
is going to be the home page so books.toscrape.com
and the spider will just iterate

00:51.840 --> 00:53.030
over books.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.230
There should be, this books

00:55.240 --> 01:02.160
variable should contain list of 20 book URLs
and we will yield request to the parse_book which

01:02.160 --> 01:05.900
is going to yield all of these
different pretty much data points.

01:05.910 --> 01:10.140
Pretty simple so there should be
item_scraped_count should be twenty.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.880
So let's actually verify that.

01:13.430 --> 01:21.040
So we type in "scrapy crawl books".
and let's see I think we haven't saved it.

01:21.410 --> 01:25.920
That's correct and we see here

01:25.920 --> 01:28.170
item_scraped_count is twenty which is perfect.

01:28.210 --> 01:32.490
There is not a single error which is great also.

01:32.590 --> 01:35.490
So everything is working correctly and fine.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.740
So let's go back to the code.

01:37.870 --> 01:41.480
There are few other modifications that needs to be added.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.310
So the first one is going to be that we
are going to import few different modules.

01:46.310 --> 01:52.750
The first one is going to be "os" or operating system,
the second one will be for example "csv" since

01:52.750 --> 01:57.490
we are going to read from the csv
to output to the MySQL database.

01:57.730 --> 02:08.200
"import glob" which is going to be reused or used
for locating the latest defined CSV file and finally

02:08.200 --> 02:19.240
we will "import MySQLdb".
The way that you actually install MySQL database in Python is,

02:19.270 --> 02:23.190
you can type in pretty much "sudo pip install"

02:23.290 --> 02:24.320
"mysql"

02:24.370 --> 02:32.090
"-python", hit Enter, we will enter the password
and this is already installed on my end.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.250
So let's see.

02:36.890 --> 02:45.200
This is for using MySQL database
or connecting it to the Python code so it can be then transferred

02:45.410 --> 02:46.770
straight to the database.

02:46.790 --> 02:50.940
And here is the Requirement is already satisfied.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.400
Perfect.

02:52.400 --> 02:57.220
Let's see what else, so rather than grabbing, let's see

02:57.260 --> 03:02.170
how many, 12 lines or 12 items let's just add

03:02.170 --> 03:02.740
few of them.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.360
So let's add the title.

03:05.360 --> 03:15.370
Let's leave that also let's keep the rating
and let's see what else we can use we can use upc.

03:15.740 --> 03:18.170
And also let's use product_type.

03:18.470 --> 03:26.360
Everything else we can delete, just to make it easier
and let's just verify that everything is working

03:26.360 --> 03:28.850
correctly.

03:28.860 --> 03:31.730
Okay, 20, perfect. So everything is working great.

03:31.770 --> 03:41.280
What needs to be added right now is
our close function so "def close" and then the

03:41.460 --> 03:43.240
well-known parameter.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.110
The first one is of course "self".

03:45.110 --> 03:48.850
The second one is "reason", we already covered this.

03:48.870 --> 03:56.310
And here we are going to get the CSV file,
and we are going to reuse the code that we already wrote and

03:56.410 --> 04:00.260
explained in previous video.

04:00.270 --> 04:07.640
So let's actually just type this in, so "*.csv"

04:08.100 --> 04:23.070
And the "key=os.path.getctime",
and let's actually print it out and

04:23.150 --> 04:27.020
let's save it. We will have to define output so "-o"

04:27.010 --> 04:32.610
and then for example "items.csv",
and let's see what is not working.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.340
It's not in the strings

04:37.500 --> 04:38.800
Okay so it printed out

04:38.820 --> 04:39.990
items.csv which

04:40.030 --> 04:40.720
is perfect.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.740
Let's remove it right now.

04:42.940 --> 04:43.720
Let's see.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.390
If it's removed, it's removed.

04:45.910 --> 04:54.000
And the way that you actually remove it is with the "rm"
and then you can define or remove 

04:54.040 --> 04:54.850
scrapy.cfg.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.120
Let's not do that.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.160
And yeah.

04:58.510 --> 05:03.980
So let's go ahead
and define our second line of code in this function close.

05:04.070 --> 05:14.080
And that will be "mydb",
and it will inherit from the "MySQLdb"
and will use the "connect".

05:15.320 --> 05:22.750
The few parameters that we are going to assign
is the first one is going to be the "host", host is

05:22.750 --> 05:24.040
going to be "localhost".

05:24.070 --> 05:35.620
So just type in localhost and then go here,
then what we need to define is "user" and that will be "root"

05:35.680 --> 05:40.500
so the root is the same one as in the.

05:40.540 --> 05:46.170
So if we go into "mysql"
and then define "-u root".

05:46.300 --> 05:47.530
This is the same user.

05:47.710 --> 05:52.750
And then let's actually just go once we are here.

05:52.850 --> 05:58.750
Just go to welcome screen to the MySQL
and move it to the next screen.

06:02.150 --> 06:06.130
Okay perfect, and what else.

06:06.150 --> 06:09.090
So what needs to be added is the password also.

06:09.120 --> 06:18.210
So the "pass" is going to be the argument type or the name,
sorry the "passwd" is going to be

06:18.210 --> 06:22.070
the argument name
and the password that I used is just "foo".

06:22.410 --> 06:24.850
This will differ on your end.

06:25.050 --> 06:28.510
And let's see what else "db" is going to be called.

06:28.650 --> 06:31.770
Let's call it "books_db".

06:31.940 --> 06:38.090
Let's actually go back to the MySQL
and then see or show databases.

06:41.570 --> 06:42.420
Okay perfect.

06:42.420 --> 06:44.300
It seems like we haven't defined it yet.

06:44.310 --> 06:49.760
So let's actually create database, so to do that

06:49.770 --> 06:57.560
we of course type in "CREATE DATABASE books_db".

06:58.560 --> 07:06.870
And then let us use it, so "USE books_db",
database changed, perfect.

07:07.140 --> 07:11.930
Let's go back to our code
and let's see, this is done.

07:11.940 --> 07:20.960
And the last thing that needs to be done here is
the "cursor" variable and that is going to be my "mydb".

07:21.060 --> 07:27.700
And then we are just going to assign or put ".cursor" in it.

07:28.410 --> 07:38.370
And "csv_data" is going to be variable name for
the "csv.reader" that is going to be from the CSV file.

07:38.370 --> 07:43.290
So this file,
and we will start to iterate over this file.

07:43.290 --> 07:47.300
So one row of data or one row by one row.

07:47.520 --> 07:58.350
This is because we are going to be, let's see.
We are going to have the items.csv number,

07:58.650 --> 08:05.690
and we are going to be having this four different column names
and we are going to iterate over each row

08:05.760 --> 08:11.920
and grab pretty much each
and every value
and put it into MySQL database.

08:12.030 --> 08:20.150
We have to of course create table with
these four column names and then assign the values

08:20.170 --> 08:20.550
in our Python code.

08:20.550 --> 08:25.720
So we will in the very next few lines we will do that.

08:26.280 --> 08:32.880
So the first thing that needs to be done is that
we have to assign "row_count = 0", because we will

08:33.060 --> 08:38.370
add a counter
and then we finally put the for loop.

08:38.760 --> 08:43.290
So this for loop will iterate over
each row from the CSV data.

08:43.290 --> 08:52.770
So from this variable or the CSV file,
and "if row_count" first and foremost is

08:52.770 --> 08:54.770
"!=0".

08:55.850 --> 08:58.060
We will execute.

08:58.140 --> 09:10.080
So we will actually at least for now pass it,
and we will then use "row_count"

09:10.110 --> 09:12.060
"+= 1"

09:12.660 --> 09:16.900
And finally we will, after this is all done.

09:16.980 --> 09:20.610
We will close out the connection to the database.

09:20.820 --> 09:30.930
To do that we type in "mydb.commit()"
and then "cursor.close()".

09:31.370 --> 09:32.370
Let's see.

09:32.610 --> 09:35.220
And finally, that will pretty much be it.

09:35.250 --> 09:43.320
So this is the most important line that we are going to write
and it's going to write the data one row

09:44.010 --> 09:56.730
by one into our MySQL database. So the cursor is going to execute,
and it's going to be or this parenthesis

09:56.760 --> 10:08.660
is going to be pretty much 
the same syntax that we would use in our

10:08.710 --> 10:09.140
MySQL shell,

10:09.150 --> 10:10.390
so right here.

10:10.740 --> 10:19.020
So what we need to type in is "INSERT IGNORE INTO books_table"

10:19.020 --> 10:29.370
for example can be the table name in our books database
so we also need to create that, the way that we create that is

10:29.370 --> 10:32.790
by actually let's see the items.csv.

10:33.150 --> 10:37.600
So the first variable names are going to be rating then:
product_type, upc and title.

10:37.650 --> 10:40.130
OK so let's see.

10:40.470 --> 10:49.670
So we are going to create table, "CREATE TABLE",
and then the table name is.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.550
Let's see "books_table".

10:55.670 --> 11:02.570
Let's see if we need to do anything else,
we need to assign our variable names.

11:02.570 --> 11:05.600
The first one is going to be let's see the rating.

11:06.110 --> 11:09.950
So "rating" is going to be

11:12.120 --> 11:13.830
"VARCHAR(20)".

11:13.900 --> 11:19.020
Also MySQL has the digits and stuff like that.

11:19.300 --> 11:28.660
We are not going to cover this
because it takes a lot of time but these are the most specific or really

11:28.660 --> 11:36.720
the most well-known type of the variable names
that exist in the MySQL db and they are flexible

11:36.720 --> 11:39.490
so that's why we are using it.

11:39.550 --> 11:45.750
Let's see the "product_type" is going to be the same type.

11:46.420 --> 11:49.720
And finally we have upc and title.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.880
so "upc" and "title".

12:00.830 --> 12:08.840
And we are going to close our parenthesis
and just put the ";" and this should work, OK perfect.

12:08.880 --> 12:18.350
So we will "SELECT * FROM books_table",
just to see if there is empty set which there should be,

12:18.680 --> 12:19.950
perfect empty set.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.620
So everything is working correctly and fine.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.380
Let's delete the CSV file.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.840
And let's go back to our code.

12:27.350 --> 12:33.270
So INSERT IGNORE INTO BOOKS TABLE
and then what we need to add is the parentheses once again.

12:33.290 --> 12:37.280
And then I add the the title.

12:37.780 --> 12:43.730
Sorry no the title

12:43.880 --> 12:46.220
but the rating.

12:46.500 --> 12:58.140
So rating, product_type, "rating, product_type",
and let's see "upc, title".

13:02.700 --> 13:06.800
And what needs to also be added is "VALUES".

13:06.810 --> 13:12.690
So these are going to be the values
that we put into each and every time.

13:12.690 --> 13:15.250
So these are all going to be strings.

13:15.270 --> 13:17.070
So we will put, let's see.

13:17.070 --> 13:20.780
This is for the value for the rating.

13:20.780 --> 13:23.250
This is for the product_type.

13:23.550 --> 13:25.560
And here we also have two others.

13:25.590 --> 13:30.260
This is for the upc
and also for the title.

13:30.270 --> 13:34.950
Finally let's just verify that it's right, product_type.

13:34.950 --> 13:39.030
And the first one is rating. So everything is great.

13:39.270 --> 13:43.910
And what needs to be added is, is this line.

13:43.950 --> 13:45.240
Finally the, let's see

13:48.270 --> 13:49.450
single quotes.

13:49.450 --> 13:53.190
And once I have here single quotes I don't need any more.

13:53.190 --> 14:01.640
And then just write the "row",
because we are going to extract from the CSV file or CSV row.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.150
And that should pretty much be it.

14:03.150 --> 14:06.120
So let's actually save it
and see if it's working.

14:06.120 --> 14:14.160
So "scrapy crawl books" and then "-o items.csv",
and seems like it's working.

14:14.310 --> 14:20.340
Let's see the CSV file is in the correct order,
so: rating, product_type, upc, title.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.040
Perfect.

14:21.040 --> 14:29.430
Let's go to our my MySQL shell and let's select once again,
it should contain 20 rows of data, perfect.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.030
So we have here:

14:32.430 --> 14:37.810
rating, product_type, also the upc and the title.
And that would be it for this video.

14:37.880 --> 14:38.640
Thanks for watching!
