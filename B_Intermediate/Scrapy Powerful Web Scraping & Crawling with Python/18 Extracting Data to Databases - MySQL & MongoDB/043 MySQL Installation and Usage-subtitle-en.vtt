00:00.540 --> 00:03.770
Hey there!
So today we are going to learn about MySQL.

00:03.930 --> 00:09.090
It's one of the most popular database,
mainly because of its ease of use.

00:09.090 --> 00:13.070
It's also open source
and it's scalable and flexible on top of that.

00:13.230 --> 00:16.870
So let's go ahead
and install it first on Linux.

00:16.870 --> 00:21.900
Process is really straightforward and you just need to
enter the following command in Terminal so you

00:21.900 --> 00:28.230
can type in "sudo apt-get install mysql-server",
hit Enter.

00:28.560 --> 00:34.980
And since I already have it installed,
I will not install it right now but if I didn't have it installed

00:35.460 --> 00:40.450
then pretty much the process would be
for you just to enter the password.

00:40.530 --> 00:44.960
That will be reused once you
access the my MySQL shell.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.700
So it's really straightforward
and it should be done in a minute or so.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.820
Now how to actually access the MySQL shell.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.820
Well, once you've have MySQL installed,
you can access the shell by typing in the following command

00:56.880 --> 01:00.280
into Terminal so you can type in

01:00.300 --> 01:01.380
"mysql -u",

01:01.470 --> 01:03.810
which stands for username.

01:03.810 --> 01:05.830
Then the username would be "root".

01:05.850 --> 01:06.880
And then "-p",

01:06.880 --> 01:08.870
which stands for password.

01:09.150 --> 01:17.280
After that we type in password that
we inputed first time that we installed MySQL server

01:17.280 --> 01:17.880
and hit Enter.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.110
After that we will get the welcome screen
and the first thing that we would for example want to do is

01:25.110 --> 01:28.190
just to see the databases currently.

01:28.190 --> 01:31.220
To do that we can type in "SHOW DATABASES;"

01:33.760 --> 01:34.240
like this.

01:34.240 --> 01:40.280
And most if not all of the MySQL commands
are going to end with a semicolon.

01:40.270 --> 01:47.950
So just remember that and hit Enter
and as you can see here we have four different databases.

01:48.340 --> 01:55.020
If you don't put the semicolon you will see that
you will not get or receive an error

01:55.160 --> 02:03.550
or you will receive another error or arrow really
that will pretty much go to the second line.

02:03.550 --> 02:08.380
So if you inputed right now the semicolon you will be fine.

02:08.980 --> 02:12.580
Let's actually quit it for now, so to do that

02:12.580 --> 02:19.510
you can just type in "quit" like this or "QUIT",
and you don't need to for some reason enter

02:19.510 --> 02:21.760
the semicolon with this command.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.290
And let's actually sign in once again 
and let's create some database so to do that we can type

02:29.470 --> 02:37.600
"CREATE DATABASE sample_db;"

02:37.600 --> 02:45.820
If we once again type in "SHOW DATABASES;"
we will see that right now we have five different databases

02:45.850 --> 02:51.190
and the last one that we have added is
"sample_db" right here.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.760
So that's all good.

02:53.080 --> 03:02.470
And to create a table which will have its name
which can be for example table example and we will enter

03:02.470 --> 03:03.310
some fields in it.

03:03.310 --> 03:12.220
So to do that you can type in "create TABLE table_example("

03:12.220 --> 03:14.300
and hit Enter.

03:14.350 --> 03:18.820
And here we will input one field or one by one field.

03:18.820 --> 03:27.190
So the first one can be since this is just a sample,
let's have "first_name" and then that variable

03:27.190 --> 03:37.450
name will have "20" or so maximum characters,
the "last_name" for example can also have the same number

03:37.450 --> 03:39.560
of maximum characters.

03:40.320 --> 03:45.640
The "gender" for example can be just character
and it will only be "1" for example.

03:45.640 --> 03:50.750
So the value will be "M" or female as

03:50.850 --> 03:52.110
"F".

03:52.190 --> 04:00.040
And let's put ",", and the last item can be
or the field can be "birthday" for example.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.790
So let's type that in
and that will be specifically "DATE".

04:03.820 --> 04:11.720
So as you can see MySQL has different kind of
characters and let's put the ")".

04:11.740 --> 04:14.190
And finally the ";".

04:14.360 --> 04:16.430
Let's see what we had.

04:16.660 --> 04:19.040
We had ERROR, No database selected.

04:19.160 --> 04:19.870
Okay perfect.

04:19.870 --> 04:21.280
So we have an error.

04:21.490 --> 04:28.840
The reason why is because we are still sort of in the home page,
we have to actually navigate to the

04:28.840 --> 04:34.800
"sample_db", so do that we can type in "USE sample_db"

04:35.500 --> 04:42.250
And as you can see we get the message that
the database is changed which is perfect.

04:42.340 --> 04:49.660
So if we type in once again the creation of the table
and then input some variable names and

04:49.660 --> 04:56.970
hit Enter we will see that query is OK
and that 0 rows are affected as of right now which is perfect.

04:57.010 --> 05:04.300
So to actually see our table we can just go ahead
and type in "SELECT *" which is going to select

05:04.450 --> 05:06.320
all or everything.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.840
"FROM table_example"

05:08.890 --> 05:13.320
So this will once again show the content of the table.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.970
Let's see, it's empty set which is perfect.

05:17.020 --> 05:23.630
So what we need to do is actually insert some fields
or values into the fields to do that.

05:23.650 --> 05:28.870
We type in "INSERT INTO table_example(".

05:28.990 --> 05:36.190
And then we'll type in the fields
that we would like to be affected.

05:36.520 --> 05:49.120
So the fields are "first_name", "last_name",
also "gender" and then the "birthday" and ")".

05:49.160 --> 05:57.200
And also another thing that has to be added is VALUES,
so the values will be "(" and

05:57.200 --> 05:58.560
then we can type in.

05:58.730 --> 06:07.460
Sort of like in Python strings so we can type in then
"Mark" which will be value for the first_name for

06:07.460 --> 06:09.560
the last_name the value can be

06:09.560 --> 06:18.170
for example "Smith", the gender in this case will be "M"
and the birthday can be

06:18.170 --> 06:24.560
for example let's say type in "1990-01-01"

06:27.190 --> 06:31.250
or really anything it doesn't really matter, let's close

06:31.250 --> 06:39.500
the parenthesis and type in ";",
and here we see another message so Query is OK.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.140
And 1 row is affected.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.200
So that's a good thing.

06:43.250 --> 06:49.420
If you remember we had that Query is OK
and that 0 rows are affected.

06:49.610 --> 06:58.450
So right now if we type in, give me a moment,
to view the table example we should get one row of data with

06:58.540 --> 06:59.620
these values.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.990
So let's see that and ";" of course.

07:03.100 --> 07:03.690
And perfect.

07:03.690 --> 07:13.240
So we have: first_name, last_name, gender and a birthday,
and to delete the table or to delete the values

07:13.620 --> 07:21.990
you can type in the command
that goes "TRUNCATE TABLE table_example".

07:24.010 --> 07:25.840
And then put the ";".

07:26.200 --> 07:32.710
And right now if we go ahead and type in
the previous command we will not get any results.

07:32.740 --> 07:39.690
As you can see it's empty set which is perfect
and to delete database we can type in

07:40.460 --> 07:45.740
"DROP DATABASE sample_db;".

07:46.150 --> 07:51.140
And if we type in to show databases, we will not see any more

07:51.160 --> 07:58.940
our sample_db, so type in "SHOW DATABASES;".

07:58.960 --> 08:03.380
And as you can see only four databases are shown.

08:03.550 --> 08:09.110
And would be pretty much it for this video,
in the very next video we will learn how to write data that

08:09.110 --> 08:13.700
is scraped to the MySQL db
and I'll see you there.
