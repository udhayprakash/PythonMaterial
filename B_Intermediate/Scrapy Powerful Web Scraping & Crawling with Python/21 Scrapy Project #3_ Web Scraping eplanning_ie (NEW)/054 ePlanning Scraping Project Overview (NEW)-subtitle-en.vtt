Hey there! So in this section, we will
scrape eplanning.ie -- planning applications.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.080
So the way that we will do that is by going 
into each and every county from this list.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.100
And after that, we will go to the only 
listings that are Received Applications.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.300
After that, we will here tackle form requests with Scrapy,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.179
and we will set 42 days as the Time Limit.
And then we will go to similar to this page.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.730
After that, we will iterate over pages 
of results. And on each and every page,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.260
we will crawl following URLs. So all
of the file numbers, table data URLs.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.510
And then if Agents button is found, 
then we will scrape data points such as

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.059
Name, Address, Phone, Fax, and also the email.
