00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.299
Hey there! So in this video, we are going 
to go into each and every file number

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.960
or, really, the application URL. 
Then we will figure out first here if we will get

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.010
Agents button present, like here. Then, 
if so, then we can proceed, which will be

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.390
discussed in the very last video or 
very next video. We will then proceed

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.929
with scraping the following data points, 
such as Name, Address, Phone, Fax, and email.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.460
If not... so something like this. So if 
Agents button is not present anywhere,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.800
then we will add just a log message, and say 
something, like, that Agents button is not found,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.690
and that we are going to pass this specific 
URL and not scrape any data points.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.670
So let's begin. So if we Inspect the Agents 
button, we will see here the input that has the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.510
value Agents in it, that class that has
button primary, and then on click we see

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.840
that JavaScript is going to be executed.
And we have here title Show Agents pop up,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.909
and also stuff like Name, Type, 
and also Style. So let's see.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.340
So first suggestion is to go to the Title 
because it should be unique. So the way that I

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.520
test it out if it's unique or not is by
copying it, and then going to a page that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.610
should not have this type of value in it.
So we go to Inspect, then Ctrl + F,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.630
and then paste it in. And, as you can see
here, even though the Agents button is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.710
not found anywhere or visible, we still
get our input. But the thing here is that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.110
if you look closely, the style that I'm highlighting 
right now on both of the pages is different.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.170
So here we get style that is 
display none, visibility hidden.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.329
The reason why, even though Agents 
button is sort of present, it's not really there

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.880
or it's set to none and the visibility 
is hidden. Here on the page

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.590
that has the Agents button, here we see
the style that has display inline, visibility visible.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.050
Okay? So this is a way that 
we can approach this problem.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.050
So we go back to the Terminal, and then 
after we open a page such as this one.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.330
So copy this and verify that we are on the
correct page. We type in response.xpath,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.920
and then in it, let's see, we are... 
we want to get to the style.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.630
That's the bottom line. And 
then if the style has this value,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.540
then we'll proceed to scrape the following
data points. If the style is not as defined here,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.650
then or, really, this will be the 
one case page. Then we will just

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.510
skip this URL and not scrape any data points 
from it because there is no Agent to be scraped. Okay?

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.989
So to do that, we are going to go 
into this value and get the Agents,

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.050
which, of course, will be present on both pages, 
even those that don't have the Agents button.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.660
Let's go back to the Terminal.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:38.320
We can paste this in. And that's it. 
So to select it, only to do this.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.820
Let's hit Enter. Okay, so it's there, and we 
also just then need to go to the @style.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.720
So similar as we've done previously with 
the href or source or images, whatever.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.040
We can do the same thing with the style. 
Hit Enter and, as you can see here, we get our data,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.319
that it's inline and that visibility is visible.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.450
We then call in extract_first, open/close parenthesis, 
and we get our Unicode data, which is great.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.459
So if we copy this, and go back to the
text editor, and name the variable name,

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:23.410
for example, agent button is equal to
this value. So then we define an if statement.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:33.070
So if... let's go to the Terminal... so if
this is present in the agent button...

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:42.040
so if this is present in agent 
button... so we can paste it in here...

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.770
then we are going to be good to go, really. We can 
scrape the data here, else. We will log our message,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.919
so self.logger info. It will
be the type of message,

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.730
and then we can type in here our message, 
really. So we can say something like

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:11.229
Agent button not found on page, comma, passing invalid url. Okay? 
And for now let's pass it so we can test it out.

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:20.620
So, finally, we can save this, go back 
to the Terminal, and run our script.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:28.290
So scrapy crawl eplanning. Hit Enter.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.440
And, let's see, it should be now loading the 
Agents button not present, somewhere here.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.120
Okay? I believe I found it 
somewhere. So let's see it.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.669
Okay, here it is. So Agent button was not
found at the page, passing invalid url.

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.419
As you can see, this is the case with also
this one. So it seems like some of them will not,

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.060
of course, have the Agents button
found on the page. And, in that case,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.380
of course, as discussed previously, we are going 
to pass or not scrape those type of data points.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.080
So the very next video will be the last one,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.600
and we will discuss scraping the data points.
