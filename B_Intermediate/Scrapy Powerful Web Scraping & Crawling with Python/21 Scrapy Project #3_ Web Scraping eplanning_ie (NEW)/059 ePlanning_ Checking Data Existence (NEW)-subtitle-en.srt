00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,299
Hey there! So in this video, we are going
to go into each and every file number

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,960
or, really, the application URL.
Then we will figure out first here if we will get

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,010
Agents button present, like here. Then,
if so, then we can proceed, which will be

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,390
discussed in the very last video or
very next video. We will then proceed

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,929
with scraping the following data points,
such as Name, Address, Phone, Fax, and email.

6
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,460
If not... so something like this. So if
Agents button is not present anywhere,

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,800
then we will add just a log message, and say
something, like, that Agents button is not found,

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,690
and that we are going to pass this specific
URL and not scrape any data points.

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,670
So let's begin. So if we Inspect the Agents
button, we will see here the input that has the

10
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,510
value Agents in it, that class that has
button primary, and then on click we see

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,840
that JavaScript is going to be executed.
And we have here title Show Agents pop up,

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,909
and also stuff like Name, Type,
and also Style. So let's see.

13
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,340
So first suggestion is to go to the Title
because it should be unique. So the way that I

14
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,520
test it out if it's unique or not is by
copying it, and then going to a page that

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,610
should not have this type of value in it.
So we go to Inspect, then Ctrl + F,

16
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,630
and then paste it in. And, as you can see
here, even though the Agents button is

17
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,710
not found anywhere or visible, we still
get our input. But the thing here is that

18
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,110
if you look closely, the style that I'm highlighting
right now on both of the pages is different.

19
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,170
So here we get style that is
display none, visibility hidden.

20
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:06,329
The reason why, even though Agents
button is sort of present, it's not really there

21
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,880
or it's set to none and the visibility
is hidden. Here on the page

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,590
that has the Agents button, here we see
the style that has display inline, visibility visible.

23
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:26,050
Okay? So this is a way that
we can approach this problem.

24
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:32,050
So we go back to the Terminal, and then
after we open a page such as this one.

25
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:40,330
So copy this and verify that we are on the
correct page. We type in response.xpath,

26
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,920
and then in it, let's see, we are...
we want to get to the style.

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,630
That's the bottom line. And
then if the style has this value,

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:58,540
then we'll proceed to scrape the following
data points. If the style is not as defined here,

29
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,650
then or, really, this will be the
one case page. Then we will just

30
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,510
skip this URL and not scrape any data points
from it because there is no Agent to be scraped. Okay?

31
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,989
So to do that, we are going to go
into this value and get the Agents,

32
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:23,050
which, of course, will be present on both pages,
even those that don't have the Agents button.

33
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,660
Let's go back to the Terminal.

34
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:38,320
We can paste this in. And that's it.
So to select it, only to do this.

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,820
Let's hit Enter. Okay, so it's there, and we
also just then need to go to the @style.

36
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:52,720
So similar as we've done previously with
the href or source or images, whatever.

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,040
We can do the same thing with the style.
Hit Enter and, as you can see here, we get our data,

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,319
that it's inline and that visibility is visible.

39
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,450
We then call in extract_first, open/close parenthesis,
and we get our Unicode data, which is great.

40
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:15,459
So if we copy this, and go back to the
text editor, and name the variable name,

41
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:23,410
for example, agent button is equal to
this value. So then we define an if statement.

42
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:33,070
So if... let's go to the Terminal... so if
this is present in the agent button...

43
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:42,040
so if this is present in agent
button... so we can paste it in here...

44
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,770
then we are going to be good to go, really. We can
scrape the data here, else. We will log our message,

45
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,919
so self.logger info. It will
be the type of message,

46
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,730
and then we can type in here our message,
really. So we can say something like

47
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:11,229
Agent button not found on page, comma, passing invalid url. Okay?
And for now let's pass it so we can test it out.

48
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:20,620
So, finally, we can save this, go back
to the Terminal, and run our script.

49
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:28,290
So scrapy crawl eplanning. Hit Enter.

50
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,440
And, let's see, it should be now loading the
Agents button not present, somewhere here.

51
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay? I believe I found it
somewhere. So let's see it.

52
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,669
Okay, here it is. So Agent button was not
found at the page, passing invalid url.

53
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:52,419
As you can see, this is the case with also
this one. So it seems like some of them will not,

54
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:58,060
of course, have the Agents button
found on the page. And, in that case,

55
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,380
of course, as discussed previously, we are going
to pass or not scrape those type of data points.

56
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,080
So the very next video will be the last one,

57
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,600
and we will discuss scraping the data points.
