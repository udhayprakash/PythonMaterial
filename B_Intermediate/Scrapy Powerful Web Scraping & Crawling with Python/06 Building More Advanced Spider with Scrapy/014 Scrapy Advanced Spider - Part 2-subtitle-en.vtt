00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:04.015
Hey there! So in this video we are going to

2
00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:07.112
scrape the three data points that were previously

3
00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:09.623
talked about in the video. So, text, author, and then

4
00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:12.557
finally the tags. So, let's begin right away.

5
00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:16.724
Let's go back to our Terminal, and put it aside for now,

6
00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:21.185
so the text will be, or this data point will be the

7
00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:24.738
first data point that we will collect.

8
00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:28.831
So to do that, we will type in quote.xpath.

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:32.997
So, this is called dynamic or custom selector,

10
00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.446
so we will not type in response.xpath we will

11
00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:39.762
type in quote.xpath.

12
00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:43.929
quote.xpath will pretty much search this entire

13
00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:48.519
HTML. So if we type in response.xpath, this will

14
00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:53.470
pretty much search the entire page or entire output or the

15
00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.326
entire page really.

16
00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:00.159
So if we type here, '//a', with the

17
00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:04.117
response.xpath, hit enter you will see that

18
00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.867
a lot of data is going to get returned.

19
00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.486
If we did the same thing with the quote or any other

20
00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:12.177
custom selector that we write we will have to use

21
00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:16.094
the dot to ensure that we get only

22
00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:23.029
content from the selector itself, so in this case

23
00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:27.255
this HTML. So we will hit Enter and as you can see

24
00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:31.035
a lot less &lt;a&gt; tags or &lt;a&gt; HTML nodes are found.

25
00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:36.531
So we will type in quote.xpath, for now we will

26
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:40.377
just leave it as it is so we will type in "." just

27
00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:44.544
not to forget. And so we go to the text, go to Inspect

28
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:50.578
and here we have &lt;span&gt; class and then value of the text,

29
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:54.648
and also itemprop which equals to the text. And then in it

30
00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:58.815
we have our text in double double quotes, so to speak.

31
00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.786
So there are multiple ways of getting to the data.

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.525
I will share two different ways, the first one will be

33
00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.428
with the class, and then the second one will be with the

34
00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:12.609
itemprop.

35
00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.776
So with the class, we go to the Terminal and type in class

36
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:20.909
so find every instance of the class. So this is pretty much

37
00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.576
the same XPath, the same XPath syntax as previously.

38
00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:29.513
So we will type in here class text, so the text will be

39
00:02:29.513 --> 00:02:33.680
the value, hit Enter, and let's see something is wrong.

40
00:02:34.468 --> 00:02:38.635
Sorry I forgot the asterisk and hit enter right now.

41
00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:42.333
And we will see that &lt;span&gt; class text, itemprop text,

42
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:45.067
is equal and then this is the double quote.

43
00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:49.234
So if we type in .extract(), you will see that we get

44
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.053
our data in the list itself.

45
00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:56.393
So to prettify it, or make it more readable,

46
00:02:56.393 --> 00:03:00.123
we should go into the text or extract text and call

47
00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:01.290
extract_first()

48
00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:06.308
Hit Enter and as you can see here's our data,

49
00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:10.308
I believe if we just print out quote we will get

50
00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:15.911
even more readable, as you can see this pretty much

51
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.227
corresponds to the double quotes that are read from here.

52
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.697
So if you type in print before the statement you will get

53
00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:28.387
sort of prettified output let's call it that way.

54
00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:32.590
So this will be the text variable, so we hit Enter

55
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:36.758
and we copy and paste it into our Text Editor.

56
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:40.758
So copy, and paste it, so we will input it here.

57
00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:45.902
The next data point that we want to collect is the author.

58
00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:51.231
So we click here inspect also, and here, oh sorry,

59
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.553
forgot to mention the second way of actually getting

60
00:03:54.553 --> 00:03:58.271
to the data, you can also use itemprop and then the text.

61
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.438
So, believe it or not it's pretty simple. You only need

62
00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:08.118
to change the class and make it itemprop, and that will be

63
00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.469
pretty much it.

64
00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.382
So the text value is going to be the same as in the class

65
00:04:14.382 --> 00:04:17.634
as you can see so if we hit Enter you will see the same

66
00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:20.641
data displayed, so if we type in here now text you will

67
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:23.743
see the same quote is going to be selected.

68
00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:27.910
Now, if we didn't use the, let's remove the variable,

69
00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:33.202
if we didn't use the dot as you will see in a moment

70
00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:36.962
if we hit Enter the same data point will be collected

71
00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:40.306
but if we type in extract() you will see that pretty much

72
00:04:40.306 --> 00:04:43.455
ten quotes will be selected, and that is the reason why

73
00:04:43.455 --> 00:04:46.645
you have to use dot when you are pretty much getting

74
00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:50.006
data from the custom selector as we did here from the

75
00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:54.173
first quote, so pretty much this statement is as same

76
00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:58.367
one as reading out response.xpath, and then

77
00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.364
this statement.

78
00:04:59.364 --> 00:05:03.531
So, you should really pay attention to not messing this up,

79
00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:09.045
because it's a bit trickier to the beginners.

80
00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:11.840
Okay, so let's begin with the authors.

81
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.424
Let's go to the Inspect and here we have the class author

82
00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:19.073
and itemprop author, so let's use for example itemprop

83
00:05:19.073 --> 00:05:20.707
author.

84
00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:24.863
Pretty much the statement is going to be the same so

85
00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:28.175
itemprop text, so instead of text the value is just

86
00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:30.834
going to be author so this is really simple.

87
00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:35.001
So, you just type in here author the itemprop, so this

88
00:05:35.684 --> 00:05:39.411
statement reads out once again find every itemprop with

89
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:42.226
the value of author select the text and select the

90
00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:43.901
first instance.

91
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:48.068
Hit Enter, and let's not forget our "." here, and hit Enter

92
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.407
and that will be pretty much our data that we are after

93
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.070
as you can see.

94
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.237
So copy and paste this into our Text Editor, so

95
00:06:01.418 --> 00:06:05.585
this will be the author is equal to this statement

96
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.237
and the final one is tags.

97
00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:13.256
This will be equal to the, pretty much, so if we go

98
00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:17.520
into Inspect, this will be from the class, so we have here

99
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.486
four different tags as you can see and each one is in the

100
00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:26.695
&lt;a&gt; HTML node and it has class and the value is tag.

101
00:06:26.957 --> 00:06:31.124
And also we can go in and scrape it from the meta class.

102
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.467
So, let's do this for example, so we can go to the itemprop

103
00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:41.010
then type in keywords, and then we can extract not the

104
00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:43.100
text but from the content.

105
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.033
As you can see it contains our data in a more readable

106
00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:47.814
format, or it's a bit easier.

107
00:06:48.123 --> 00:06:52.290
So itemprop, so let's go to the Terminal, so we go and

108
00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:57.807
and, go to the itemprop and then value is going to be

109
00:06:57.982 --> 00:07:02.149
keyword so we can copy and paste it pretty much.

110
00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:06.793
Paste it here, and then hit Enter and as you will see in

111
00:07:08.283 --> 00:07:11.931
a moment nothing will happen and the reason why is because

112
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.251
we are selecting the text but what we want to do is select

113
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.644
the content as you can see from here.

114
00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:22.139
So we type in, the syntax is a bit different, so you type in

115
00:07:22.472 --> 00:07:26.542
"@" at this point and then content, hit Enter and as you

116
00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:28.817
as you can see here is our data.

117
00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:33.742
You can also write the class and then tag, so to do that

118
00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:39.012
we will use the extract(), we will select the text(),

119
00:07:42.518 --> 00:07:46.500
because we are going to select the, this pretty much

120
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.316
data points that I'm highlighting right now.

121
00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:53.483
And here we will use the tag, and finally it will not be

122
00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.695
itemprop it will be class.

123
00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:58.824
So as you can see it's fairly simple and straightforward,

124
00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:02.991
and in this case we have just a list of the tags and here

125
00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:07.745
we have the string or unicode of the tag so either one

126
00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:09.219
will do the job.

127
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:14.796
Copy and paste the output or the statement from the

128
00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:19.611
Terminal, paste it in and that will be pretty much it

129
00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:22.523
for this video.

130
00:08:22.523 --> 00:08:25.846
So in the very next one we will print out our data to the

131
00:08:25.846 --> 00:08:30.013
Scrapy shell and we will start to iterate over the pages of

132
00:08:30.702 --> 00:08:33.740
the results and grab a hundred or so different quotes.

133
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.573
See you there!
