Hey There! So in this video, we are going to cover
how to install Scrapy on Mac operating system

00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:12.626
Recent systems with Mac come with
Python 2 out of the box

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:14.835
a.k. pre-installed

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:21.057
So unless you want to install Python 3,
you do not have to install or configure Python yourself

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:27.088
Now if I go to the Terminal
So type in here: Terminal

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.932
and press Enter

00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:32.743
and type in here: python

00:00:32.743 --> 00:00:35.090
and hit once again Enter

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.357
this will start the Python Interpreter

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:42.981
and show some information such as for example
the type (version) of Python that is currently installed

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:44.537
So we are ready to go

00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:48.957
If we type in now: exit()

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:50.333
hit Enter once again

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:54.103
it will redirect us to the normal
Terminal command promt

00:00:54.103 --> 00:00:56.361
where we can install packages

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:59.439
The installation process for Scrapy on Mac
is straightforward

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:04.565
So you can just type in:
sudo pip install scrapy

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:06.572
hit Enter

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:09.628
It will prapably ask you for 
your system password

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:12.628
So you can type it also in
and hit Enter once again

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.221
As you can see here, we are collecting Scrapy

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:20.432
and some requirements, 
might be already satisfied

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.168
Let's see

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.146
And as you can see,
we successfully installed scrapy

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:27.512
Subtitle

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:29.173
So we are ready to go

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:32.911
To verify it, you type in: scrapy

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:33.970
and hit Enter

00:01:37.938 --> 00:01:43.873
If successfully installed, Scrapy will show 
the type (version) of Scrapy that is installed

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:45.328
and also "Available Commands"

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.789
Let's also install IPython

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.138
as we will need to run 
Scrapy Shell with it

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:59.001
To install IPython, just type in:
sudo pip install ipython

00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:01.941
and then just hit Enter

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:06.347
And as you can see,
it has successfully installed IPython

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:12.504
So that will be
pretty much it for this video

00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:17.589
If you encounter any kind of issues 
or errors in the installation process

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.240
