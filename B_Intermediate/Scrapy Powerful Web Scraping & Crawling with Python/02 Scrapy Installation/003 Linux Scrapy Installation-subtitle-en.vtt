00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.842
- [Instructor] Hey there, so today we are going

2
00:00:02.842 --> 00:00:05.272
to cover how to install Scrapy.

3
00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.444
We will use the process that's used

4
00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:09.968
with the Linux Ubuntu Operating System.

5
00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:13.704
So if we head over to scrapy.org, load the page,

6
00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:17.818
and you will see at the top of the page, Documentation link.

7
00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.978
So let's click the Documentation,

8
00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.818
and as you just moments ago saw

9
00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:24.332
it will redirect us to the latest

10
00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:27.083
official Scrapy Documentation.

11
00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:29.144
Since we want to install Scrapy

12
00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.927
we will go to the Installation Guide,

13
00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:35.488
which is located here on the left Navigation Bar.

14
00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:38.154
So let's click the Installation Guide,

15
00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:41.040
and once the page is loaded

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.212
we will go to the Platform Specific Installation Notes

17
00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:45.462
and click this,

18
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.225
and since we would like to install this for Ubuntu

19
00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:51.874
we can click this here.

20
00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:54.979
And this process pretty much explains here

21
00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.146
the Installation Guide for Ubuntu 12.04 or above,

22
00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.354
as you can see, which you are probably using.

23
00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.025
So, since Scrapy is a framework

24
00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:06.358
it has several dependencies.

25
00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:09.453
Some dependencies might be already installed,

26
00:01:09.453 --> 00:01:11.428
and some might not,

27
00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:14.668
and pretty much this command that I'm highlighting right now

28
00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:17.756
installs all dependencies that are required

29
00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:20.426
on Ubuntu to run properly Scrapy.

30
00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:23.190
So since it's already ready for you,

31
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.397
let's copy and paste it to the Terminal.

32
00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:28.506
So we go here to the Copy,

33
00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.616
and then open new Terminal,

34
00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:32.366
and Paste it here,

35
00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:36.907
and then this will require the password,

36
00:01:36.907 --> 00:01:39.759
you enter the password, hit Enter,

37
00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.999
and it should install itself.

38
00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.340
Then if you would want to go to this command

39
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.277
to install Scrapy, pip install scrapy,

40
00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:52.277
let's navigate back to the Terminal,

41
00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:56.293
and type in: sudo pip install scrapy

42
00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:01.326
If you don't type in sudo it will probably

43
00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:05.493
require you to type it in to type the password.

44
00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:08.043
So hit Enter once again,

45
00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:12.210
and once it's installed, we will install the IPython.

46
00:02:12.768 --> 00:02:16.935
IPython is used later on for the Scrapy shell.

47
00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:20.363
So to do or to install IPython

48
00:02:20.363 --> 00:02:24.363
you should just type in sudo pip install IPython

49
00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:28.767
and hit Enter, and then once it's installed

50
00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:30.556
that's pretty much it.

51
00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:33.999
So to figure out if you've installed Scrapy correctly,

52
00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.024
you should just type in scrapy,

53
00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:38.200
in the Terminal, hit Enter,

54
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.306
and it will load the Scrapy version,

55
00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:45.473
and also if there are any active projects, et cetera.

56
00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:50.299
Or the other process is to type in python, hit Enter,

57
00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:54.402
and then type in: import scrapy.

58
00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:56.123
If it loads without any errors

59
00:02:56.123 --> 00:02:58.081
you are pretty much good to go.

60
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:00.747
Then to exit the Python shell,

61
00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.700
just type in: exit()

62
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.260
and hit Enter, that's pretty much it.

63
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.196
So if you encounter any kind of issues,

64
00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:11.879
make sure to head over to our Q&amp;A section

65
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.921
and ask for help.

66
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.576
And I'll see you in the very next video.
