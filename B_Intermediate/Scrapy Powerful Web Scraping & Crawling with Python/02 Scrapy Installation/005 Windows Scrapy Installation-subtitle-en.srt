00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,116
Hey there! So today we are going to learn

2
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:04,452
how to install Scrapy on a Windows machine.

3
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:07,319
So if we head over to the scrapy.org,

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:08,977
then go to the "Documentation",

5
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:12,502
it will redirect us to the latest documents.

6
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:16,441
Then we should head over to the "installation guide".

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,093
After that we can either install Anaconda or Miniconda.

8
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:23,533
The tool that we'll install is called Anaconda.

9
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,273
So then we go to "download Anaconda"

10
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:28,769
and this will open a new tab to specify

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,529
the operating system that you have,

12
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,016
so since this is the installation process for Windows

13
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:35,415
we will go over to Windows,

14
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:38,827
and then here we have four different packages.

15
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:42,879
We'll install Python 2.7 64-bit installer.

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,046
Click here to download it, save the file and click here "x",

17
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:52,091
and then wait [some time] to be downloaded.

18
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:54,424
After that, we open the file,

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,488
and once this prompts usو we will click here "Run".

20
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:04,279
The installation process is fairly simple

21
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:07,237
and straightforward, "Next", "I Agree",

22
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,320
and check here "All Users".

23
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:15,892
Click here "Yes", "Next", and then

24
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:20,395
"Add Anaconda to the system PATH environment variable"

25
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:22,167
and click here "Install".

26
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,601
Installation will take a few minutes,

27
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,733
maybe up to 10 minutes or so,

28
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,504
so I'll pause the video right now

29
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:32,671
and then get back to you as soon as it's done.

30
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:36,682
Okay, so it's completed, we click here "Next",

31
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:40,250
and then we uncheck these two options,

32
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,285
and finally click "Finish".

33
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:44,303
We head over to the documentation

34
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:47,663
and then pretty much just copy and paste this command.

35
00:01:47,663 --> 00:01:51,330
We go and hit the Windows key, then type in "cmd"

36
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:54,959
which is going to be "Command Prompt",

37
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,186
and then just paste the command

38
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,522
"pip install scrapy" and hit Enter.

39
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,769
This will install Scrapy

40
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,843
and all the dependencies that Scrapy relies on,

41
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:09,760
and it should be completed in 30 or so seconds.

42
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:20,793
Some of the dependencies are already, as you can see,

43
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:23,286
all requirements are already satisfied,

44
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:26,520
so the installation should not take more

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,280
than 10 seconds right now.

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,519
And if you encounter any type of issues or errors,

47
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,225
make sure to head over to our Q&amp;A section,

48
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:39,378
and just really ask questions

49
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:42,467
or really ask about the error that you received.

50
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,679
So as you can see, it's completed.

51
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,094
If we type in right now "python"

52
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:49,223
and then type in "import scrapy" to verify

53
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:51,711
that everything is installed correctly,

54
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,257
we should not get any types of errors,

55
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,342
so as you can see it works perfectly well.

56
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,042
So that will be it for this video

57
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:00,438
and I'll see you in the very next one.
