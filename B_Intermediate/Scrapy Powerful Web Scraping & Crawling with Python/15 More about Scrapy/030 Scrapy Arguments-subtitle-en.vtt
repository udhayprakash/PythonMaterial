Hi there!

00:00.570 --> 00:05.670
So today we are going to learn more about Scrapy arguments,
what they are and how you can use them in your

00:05.670 --> 00:06.130
code.

00:06.190 --> 00:10.270
In this specific example we will use it
to isolate different categories.

00:10.290 --> 00:16.230
So for example if you want to scrape just Philosophy related books.
In this case we will gather

00:16.690 --> 00:21.400
11 books and will only scrape pretty much this URLs.

00:21.420 --> 00:27.810
And then from then on extract data points
from the code that we built last time which

00:27.810 --> 00:28.350
we are going to reuse.

00:28.350 --> 00:32.700
So the code that needs to be updated is pretty short.

00:32.700 --> 00:38.280
We need to remove the start_urls and then
define our constructor which of course is going to be

00:38.280 --> 00:39.020
"__init__"

00:39.060 --> 00:44.300
And then define two arguments, the first one is going to
be obviously "self" and then the second one

00:44.390 --> 00:45.670
will be "category".

00:45.690 --> 00:49.870
This can be pretty much anything 
but in this case let's use just category.

00:50.040 --> 00:54.640
And then we type in

00:54.690 --> 01:01.590
"self.start_urls = [category]",
which will correlate or which will be

01:01.610 --> 01:02.190
this URL for example.

01:02.190 --> 01:10.950
So let's save the code, go back to the root directory,
open Terminal and then type in "scrapy crawl books".

01:10.950 --> 01:12.680
So this obviously stays the same.

01:12.690 --> 01:16.840
And then we need to append "-a"
which stands for arguments obviously.

01:17.070 --> 01:24.150
And then define the category, which correlates to
this argument in our constructor and we type in here

01:24.450 --> 01:25.710
single or double quotes

01:25.710 --> 01:31.680
in this case and then copy and paste this URL, and here the item_scraped_count should be 11,

01:31.680 --> 01:33.450
which it is which is perfect.

01:33.450 --> 01:36.980
So let's try one another different category.

01:37.260 --> 01:41.420
Let's say for example we want to scrape History related books here.

01:41.460 --> 01:44.640
We should get 18 results.

01:44.650 --> 01:45.220
Or 18 books scraped.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.650
So let's see.

01:47.850 --> 01:48.340
"-a"

01:48.390 --> 01:56.780
And then the "category" which is going to be the URL, perfect.

01:56.830 --> 01:58.810
So that'll be it for this video.

01:58.810 --> 02:05.050
Once again the arguments or Scrapy arguments
can be used for isolating different categories.

02:05.050 --> 02:11.230
For example if you have thousands and thousands of
History related books or if you need to in future

02:11.230 --> 02:18.940
for example run it for Science books only or stuff like that
or you need to assign some special rule

02:18.940 --> 02:24.370
or something like that for your scraper then you should
use Scrapy arguments and that would it for this video.

02:24.400 --> 02:29.200
In the very next one, we will talk about
a Scrapy function called close. Talk soon!
