00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,100
Hi there, so today we are going to talk
about Scrapy feed exports.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,410
The reason why we build Spiders is because we want to
gather data from the sites; gathered data is then exported

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,450
to the various data formats.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,960
Traditionally if you're building Spider from the ground up
you will have to build data experts yourself.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,130
But Scrapy

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:28,080
out of the box offers to save data to CSV, JSON and XML,
which in a moment we will run, which in other words

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,330
helps out really tremendously when it comes to
speeding up coding spiders so you will spend less time

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,370
worrying if your exports are not working correctly.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
So let's run a few examples.

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,420
And the way that we are going to run is by typing
scrapy crawl books

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,570
Feed exports are defined by
"-o" which stands for output.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,760
For example we will name the output,
for example "items",

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,860
it doesn't really matter.

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:06,260
What matters is the extension so CSV or JSON or XML,
once again is supported out of the box.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:15,590
Let's try the ".csv" which is going to yield a bunch of column names.
The column names are going to be from

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,870
the yield statement that we specified here
from the dictionary keys.

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,530
And here are pretty much results in this case.

18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,080
The other data format as I was saying is JSON.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,680
So just to run it with or to output the data
in to JSON just type in ".json".

20
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:42,470
Let's run it and let's open the file that is getting generated
in the root directory in the text editor

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,830
and let's prettify it.

22
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:51,530
And as you can see in this curly brackets
we get the one row of the data for example that will be represented

23
00:01:51,530 --> 00:02:01,340
in the CSV file and the latest output or feed export
that Scrapy offers is XML, let's run that.

24
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:15,630
And if we open the .xml file, in Chrome or in your text editor,
we will see again in the results

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,970
pretty much in the XML output.

26
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:26,740
So once again this helps out tremendously when building Spiders
and saves a lot of time and you can of course

27
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:34,900
output data to TXT or write Spiders to output data to TXT

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,540
or some database like MySQL.

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,490
And that would be it for this video.

30
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,850
And thanks for watching.

31
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,260
Bye!
