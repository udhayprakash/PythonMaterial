Hi there, so today we are going to talk
about Scrapy feed exports.

00:04.140 --> 00:10.410
The reason why we build Spiders is because we want to
gather data from the sites; gathered data is then exported

00:10.410 --> 00:12.450
to the various data formats.

00:12.450 --> 00:17.960
Traditionally if you're building Spider from the ground up
you will have to build data experts yourself.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.130
But Scrapy

00:19.140 --> 00:28.080
out of the box offers to save data to CSV, JSON and XML,
which in a moment we will run, which in other words

00:28.230 --> 00:33.330
helps out really tremendously when it comes to
speeding up coding spiders so you will spend less time

00:33.330 --> 00:36.370
worrying if your exports are not working correctly.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.520
So let's run a few examples.

00:39.150 --> 00:45.420
And the way that we are going to run is by typing
scrapy crawl books

00:45.420 --> 00:50.570
Feed exports are defined by
"-o" which stands for output.

00:50.580 --> 00:56.760
For example we will name the output,
for example "items",

00:56.770 --> 00:57.860
it doesn't really matter.

00:57.860 --> 01:06.260
What matters is the extension so CSV or JSON or XML,
once again is supported out of the box.

01:06.260 --> 01:15.590
Let's try the ".csv" which is going to yield a bunch of column names.
The column names are going to be from

01:15.590 --> 01:20.870
the yield statement that we specified here
from the dictionary keys.

01:21.530 --> 01:23.530
And here are pretty much results in this case.

01:23.570 --> 01:29.080
The other data format as I was saying is JSON.

01:29.120 --> 01:35.680
So just to run it with or to output the data
in to JSON just type in ".json".

01:35.870 --> 01:42.470
Let's run it and let's open the file that is getting generated
in the root directory in the text editor

01:42.770 --> 01:44.830
and let's prettify it.

01:45.110 --> 01:51.530
And as you can see in this curly brackets
we get the one row of the data for example that will be represented

01:51.530 --> 02:01.340
in the CSV file and the latest output or feed export
that Scrapy offers is XML, let's run that.

02:04.330 --> 02:15.630
And if we open the .xml file, in Chrome or in your text editor,
we will see again in the results

02:15.640 --> 02:18.970
pretty much in the XML output.

02:18.970 --> 02:26.740
So once again this helps out tremendously when building Spiders
and saves a lot of time and you can of course

02:26.740 --> 02:34.900
output data to TXT or write Spiders to output data to TXT

02:34.900 --> 02:35.540
or some database like MySQL.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.490
And that would be it for this video.

02:37.510 --> 02:38.850
And thanks for watching.

02:39.050 --> 02:39.260
Bye!
