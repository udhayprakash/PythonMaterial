00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,790
Hey there! So today we are going to learn
how to load the page with the user agent setting.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,670
So why we would like to do that
is because on some pages, such as

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,770
currently on amazon.com, if we load,
for example, this type of page where we

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,529
have the person profile, and then the
products, and any other data points, if we

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,349
try to load it just with the Scrapy
default opener, it will not work.

6
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,980
So if we go to the Terminal... or the shell,
so type in scrapy shell and then in either

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:43,079
single or double quotes, we can copy and paste
this URL. Hit Enter. And as you can see here,

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,070
we get the 403 response status.
And if we type in view(response),

9
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:56,670
hit Enter, you will see that no data will be
loaded. So what we need to do here is exit.

10
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,719
Then append on the scrapy shell
opener -s which stands for settings,

11
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,430
and then all uppercase USER_AGENT=""

12
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:17,340
and then we will parse the user agent. How do you
know what or what exactly is the valid user agent?

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,430
Well, you'll just type in user agent, and then go to:

14
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,860
whoishostingthis.com/tools/user-agent/.
And you can then pretty much copy and paste

15
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,299
your personal user agent. Of course,
you can use any other valid user agents.

16
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,850
So if you copy this, then go back to
the Terminal and paste this into here,

17
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,520
and then type in Enter, you can see, right now,
200 response status, which means that it's successful.

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,180
So if we type in, right now, view(response),
you can see that data will be loaded.

19
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,159
Also, how do you actually
do this in the Scrapy project?

20
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,819
Well, you just go to the settings.py file
and then use the... let's see where it is exactly.

21
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:13,400
You can pretty much copy and paste this
pretty much variable name. So USER_AGENT=""

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,700
and then in the quotes,
you type in the user agent,

23
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,670
and you will be good to go. So sometimes,
as you can see, pages will not get loaded if

24
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,239
they don't have the proper
user agent set up previously.
