00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey there! So this is the third part of
our LinkedIn automation project.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,000
And in this specific part, we'll talk
about how to create a Python file,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,700
which is going to be called parameters.py,
which is going to have a variable name,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,800
such as search term, file name, and,
really, linkedin username and passwords,

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,200
which will simplify our main script.py file.
So let's begin right away. So let's create it.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,800
Right click it on the Desktop. And then type in
or, really, just create an empty document.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:43,600
Let's see. Let's rename it to parameters.py.
Let's open it with the text editor,

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,800
and then we can type in search_query,

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,500
which is going to be equal to the... let's see,
which is going to be, pretty much,

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:02,000
equal to this one. So we can copy this,
paste it in, and let's type in also file_name,

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,510
which is going to be... we will enter our
results from scraping profiles into CSV files.

12
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:23,400
So we can type in results_file.csv. And
then we can enter our linkedin_username = ' '

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,900
And also linkedin_password is going
to be equal to the single or double quotes.

14
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,000
So here you will enter your email.
And here you will enter your password.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,300
So if we go back to the script, the things
that we need to import is first the parameters.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,500
So, really, it's... when it comes to Python,

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,500
it's going to be easy as import
parameters. That's it, really.

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,900
So then here, we can, let's see,
on the username.send_keys,

19
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:04,000
you can type in parameters dot, and
then use your linkedin_username.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,100
Copy and paste this. And then also
for the password, same thing.

21
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:18,200
So we are inheriting from the parameters
module linkedin_password. Paste this in,

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,720
and let's see if there is something else
that we need to do. Let's also use here...

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,600
let's see, sleep functions. So we can
use here sleeping for three seconds.

24
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:38,300
So after inputting this, we can sleep for 0.5.
So after inputting the search query,

25
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,300
which is going to be equal to the
parameters dot... let's see, search_query.

26
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:52,900
So we can copy this, go back to our script,
paste this in. And then after, really,

27
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,900
pressing the Return or Enter key,
we can type in for, let's say, 3 seconds.

28
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,000
Here we can sleep for probably 0.5,
but it's probably not needed.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,500
And let's see if there's something else.
Yeah, I believe that's pretty much it.

30
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:16,000
So let's see if this is actually going to work. Right now,
I'll pause this video and enter my credentials here

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
in the linkedin_username and
linkedin_password variable names.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Save the file, and also we can
right away save the script,

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:33,400
and enter this into the Terminal. Okay, so
username and password are entered,

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,000
and I believe we can, pretty much, start the script.
So we go to the Desktop, open the Terminal,

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,500
navigate to the... let's zoom this in a little bit.
Navigate to the Desktop, so cd Desktop/

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,600
and then we can type in python script.py.
Hit Enter, and let's see if this is going to be working.

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,510
So it goes to linkedin.com. As you can see,

38
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,670
it enters our credentials.
It loads the page perfectly fine.

39
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,500
And, let's see, now it should go to the...
after sleeping in to google.com.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,600
And then entering our specific search query,
and loading the page. And it should be,

41
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,500
pretty much, then, yeah, ended.
Perfect.  So it works. The only thing, really,

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,000
that we need to add here is
the driver.quit. So driver.quit()

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And that's pretty much it. So here,
or right now, we will go back to our...

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,100
developing our automation tool. And
we will do this in the very next video.

45
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,380
So I'll see you there.
