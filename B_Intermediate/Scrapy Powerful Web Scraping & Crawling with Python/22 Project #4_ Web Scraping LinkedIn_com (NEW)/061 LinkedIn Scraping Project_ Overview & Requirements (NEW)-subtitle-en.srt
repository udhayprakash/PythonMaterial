00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,130
Hey there! So in this section, we will
automate scraping LinkedIn profiles.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,900
We will scrape from each and every profile
data points such as name, job title, school,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,929
location, and also URL. Finally, we will
then connect to each and every person.

4
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,529
We will iterate over Google's results from
a given search query. So... and the tool

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,060
that we will use is called Selenium.
So if this is the first time really that

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,669
you encounter Selenium, then make sure
to get over, and then just type in Selenium

7
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,399
at the Course Content. And first watch
Section 1 where we compare Scrapy

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,399
versus other frameworks, such as Selenium
here. And then, also, this section where we

9
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,070
talk about how to actually install or
when or why you would use Selenium, how

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,730
to install Selenium, and also
how to download ChromeDriver,

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,149
which we'll use for this project. So, again, just
make sure to get yourself familiar with Selenium.

12
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,489
That being said, the first part of this
project will be dealing with linkedin.com.

13
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,350
So we'll head over to the home
page, and then navigate, and then

14
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,990
input both username and also password.
And then clicking in or automating

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,090
clicking in the Sign-In button. We have
to be signed in because, otherwise,

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,460
connecting to people and generally
scraping data from LinkedIn is, as of

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,369
right now, it's not possible most of the
time to get to the data otherwise.

18
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,710
Then we will use Google with the predefined
search query, such as, for example, this one.

19
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,590
Then we will automate clicking Enter.
And then we are going to pretty much

20
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,229
iterate over these green URLs. So we will
scrape those URLs. And then from each

21
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,600
and every URL, which will go to the
profile page, we will scrape once again

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,049
name, job title, school, location, and
also URL. And, finally, we will connect.

23
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,360
For some reason, this person doesn't have
the Connect button, so let's see a few more.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,650
Some of them have it. Perfect. So we
will then click here Connect, and then

25
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:18,550
automate clicking Send Now button. And,
as you can see, your invitation to this

26
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,560
person was sent, so everything is
working fine. So let's get started right away.
