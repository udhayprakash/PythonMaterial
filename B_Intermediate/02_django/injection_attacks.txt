SQL INJECTION
==============

    username = request.GET['username']

    my_query = """
            SELECT * FROM users
            WHERE username = %s' """% username

    result = db_cursor.execute(my_query)

---------
''; UPDATE users SET is_superuser = true WHERE username = 'haxor'; --


MAIL HEADER INJECTION
======================
An email-sending form can be tricked into sending to unintended recipients


COMMAND INJECTION
==================
An application which triggers shell commands with user input as a parameter can be tricked shell commands with user
input as a parameter can e tricked into executing other, arbitrary shell commands


XML INJECTION
==============
An XML processor is tricked into handling unsafe input (perhaps containing scripts, entity definitions which
expand to perform network requests or reveal contents of system files, etc.)

Almost anything which takes user input ad does something with that input --- potential source of injection
