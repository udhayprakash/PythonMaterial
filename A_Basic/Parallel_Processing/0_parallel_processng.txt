Parallel processing 
    - mode of operation where the task is executed simultaneously 
    in multiple processors in the same computer. 
    - PROS
        - It is meant to reduce the overall processing time.
    - CONS
        - a bit of overhead when communicating between processes 
        which can actually increase the overall time taken for small 
        tasks instead of decreasing it.
    - multiprocessing 
        - used to run independent parallel processes by using 
        subprocesses (instead of threads) i.e., the processes can 
        be run in completely separate memory locations.

- parallel processing
    - two types of execution: 
        - Synchronous 
            - one the processes are completed in the same order in which it was started. 
            This is achieved by locking the main program until the respective processes are finished.
        - Asynchronous
            - doesnâ€™t involve locking. 
            - As a result, the order of results can get mixed up but usually gets done quicker.



multiprocessing module methods to implement parallel execution
    - The Pool Class 
        - Synchronous execution
            - Pool.map() and Pool.starmap()
            - Pool.apply()
        - Asynchronous execution
            - Pool.map_async() and Pool.starmap_async()
            - Pool.apply_async())
    - The Process Class
