Problem Statement: 
	Assume that price is an integer variable whose value is the price (in US currency) in cents of an item.
	Write a statement that prints the value of price in the form "X dollars and Y cents" on a line by itself.
	So, if the value of price was 4321, your code would print "43 dollars and 21 cents". 
	Ex: If the value was 501 it would print "5 dollars and 1 cents".
	Ex: If the value was 99 your code would print "0 dollars and 99 cents".
