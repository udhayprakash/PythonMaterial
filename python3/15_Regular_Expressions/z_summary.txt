############# CONTROL CHARACTERS ############
# All characters except the following 14 characters match themselves. The following 14 characters are control characters, with special meaning below. If you want to match any literal version of control characters, prefix it with a backslash.
*   : matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding expression greedily
+   : matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding expression greedily
?   : matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding expression non-greedily
.   : matches any character except for \n
^   : matches beginning of a string respectively.
$   : matches ending of a string respectively.
|   : matches either of the expressions around the | symbol
[ ] : matches any of the characters listed inside []; a hyphen (-) denotes alphanumeric ranges; ^ right after opening square bracket makes it match any character except for the listed ones.
( ) : used to capture portions of an expression; also used to denote precedence especially in complex expressions; (?:...) makes represents the non-grouping version of ().
{ } : {m,n} matches m to n repetitions of the preceding expression
\   : used to escape control characters or signal a control sequence (e.g. \w, \W etc.) or special characters such as \n, \t etc.

############## PYTHON SPECIFIC EXTENSIONS ?P DISCUSSED IN THIS ARTICLE ################
(?P<name>...) The substring matched by the group is accessible by name.
(?P=name)     Matches the text matched earlier by the group named name.

############## FLAGS IN PYTHON SPECIFIC EXTENSIONS ?P ################
i: tells the searching engine to ignore case
L: makes \w, \b, and \s locale dependent
m: enables multiline expression
s: the dotall flag; it makes the dot match all characters, including newline character
u: makes \w, \b, \d, and \s unicode dependent
x: makes the expression verbose i.e. ignores unescaped whitespace as well as text after # sign i.e. it treats text after # as comments.

############# VALID VALUES FOR OPTIONAL ARGUMENT flag IN FUNCTIONS OF re MODULE ###############
A  also re.ASCII        Makes \w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D match the corresponding ASCII character categories
                        (rather than the whole Unicode categories, which is the default) for string patterns.
I  also re.IGNORECASE   Enables case-insensitive matching.
L  also re.LOCALE       Makes \w, \W, \b, \B dependent on the current locale.
M  also re.MULTILINE    Makes "^" match the beginning of lines (after a newline) as well as the string.
                        "$" matches the end of lines (before a newline) as well as the end of the string.
S  also re.DOTALL       Makes "." match any character at all, including the newline.
X  also re.VERBOSE      Asks Regex Engine to ignore whitespace and comments.
U  also re.UNICODE      Asks the Regex Engine to use the Unicode character set for substitution, which is default for string patterns.

############### CONTROL SEQUENCES ###############
\d       matches numerals or digits; is equivalent to the character class [0-9]
\D       matches non-numeral or non-digit characters; equivalent to [^0-9]
\s       matches whitespace characters such as \t (tab), \n (linefeed), \r (carriage return), \v (vertical tab), \f (formfeed) etc.
\S       matches non-whitespace character; equivalent to [^\t\n\r\v\f]
\w       matches alphanumeric characters; equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]
\W       matches non-alphanumeric characters; equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
\number  matches the contents captured by the group denoted by the same number; we will discuss groups shortly.
\A       matches only at the start of the original string.
\Z       matches only at the end of the original string.
\b       matches an empty string at word boundaries; \b is defined as the boundary between a \w & \W character or between \w and the two ends of a string; note that you will need to write your regex containing \b sequences with raw string notation i.e. r'patternContaining\bSequences', since \b in regular string notation denotes the backspace character. Alternatively, you can use two backslashes to mean the same i.e. 'patternContaining\\bSequences'.
\B       matches an empty string not at word boundaries i.e. re.search('\Bam\B', 'name') will get return a match whereas '\Bn' will not, since there is a word boundary right before the letter n;
# In order to match a literal backslash, use the raw string notation, i.e. re.search(r'\\', 'x\\y'). Alternatively, you can escape both the backslashes by prefixing each of them with another backslash i.e. re.search('\\\\', 'x\\y')

######### FUNCTIONS OF re MODULE DISCUSSED IN THIS ARTICLE ############
* match(pattern, stringSource, flags=0) applies the pattern at the beginning of the string and returns a match object if a match is found, and if no match is found, returns None
* search(pattern, stringSource, flags=0) applies the pattern in the entire of the string and returns a match object if a match is found, and if no match is found, returns None
* compile(pattern, flags=0) compiles a pattern to return a pattern object, making it convenient for us in case we need to apply the same pattern to different strings.
* fullmatch(pattern, string, flags=0) performs an anchored search like match(), but returns a match object only if the expression matches the entire string OR the expression matches a portion of string denoted by span indexes specified in optional 2nd and 3rd arguments.
* sub(pattern, replacement, stringSource) function replaces the occurrences of pattern in stringSource by replacement, and returns the modified string (if no substitutions are made, it returns the original string). The pattern may be either a simple string or a regular expression. The replacement may be either a string or a function.
* subn(pattern, replacement, stringSource) performs the same function as sub(), except for the fact that it returns a 2-element tuple, consisting of the new string after the replacement(s) and number of substitutions made.
* split(pattern, stringSource, maxsplit = 0, flags = 0) splits the stringSource on the basis of occurrences of the pattern, returning a list of resulting substrings.
* findall(pattern, stringSource, flags = 0) returns a list of all matches (including empty ones) in the stringSource. If capturing groups exist in the pattern, the list of tuples of matches of these groups is returned.
* finditer(pattern, stringSource, flags = 0) performs the same way as findall(), except for the fact that it returns an iterator of match objects in case there are no capturing groups, instead of a list. If there are groups in the expression, then an iterator of tuples of matches of these groups is returned.
* escape(pattern) asks the regular expression engine to escape all the characters in pattern except letters, numbers & underscore(_).
* purge()function clears the regular expression caches.

############ FUNCTIONS OF MATCH OBJECT DISCUSSED IN THIS ARTICLE ############
* end(): returns index of the original string where the match ended.
* groups(): returns a tuple of groups of the matched string.
* groupdict(): returns a dictionary of named groups of the matched string.
* group(): returns a specific group of the matches string.
* re: attribute storing the regular expression object whose search()/match() produced this match object.
* span(): returns a 2-element tuple denoting the indexes of the original string where the match starts and ends.
* start(): returns index of the original string where the match started.
* string: attribute which stores the original string.
