Purpose: Discussion on unicode strings

ASCII - english only 

ENCODING: Unicode string is a sequence of code points, 
    which are numbers from 0 through 0x10FFFF (1,114,111 decimal). 
    This sequence needs to be represented as a set of bytes (meaning,
    values from 0 through 255) in memory. The rules for translating a 
    Unicode string into a sequence of bytes are called an encoding.

RULES of converting Unicode string to ASCII encoding
----------------------------------------------------
for each code point:
    - If the code point is < 128, each byte is the same as the value of the code point.
    - If the code point is 128 or greater, the Unicode string can’t be represented in this encoding. 
    (Python raises a UnicodeEncodeError exception in this case.)

UTF - Unicode Transformation Format
UTF-8 - 8-bit numbers

UTF-8 uses the following rules:
    - If the code point is < 128, it’s represented by the corresponding byte value.
    - If the code point is >= 128, it’s turned into a sequence of two, three, or four bytes, where each byte of the sequence is between 128 and 255.
UTF-8 has several convenient properties:

It can handle any Unicode code point.
    - A Unicode string is turned into a sequence of bytes containing no embedded zero bytes. This avoids byte-ordering issues, and means UTF-8 strings can be processed by C functions such as strcpy() and sent through protocols that can’t handle zero bytes.
    - A string of ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text.
    - UTF-8 is fairly compact; the majority of commonly used characters can be represented with one or two bytes.
    - If bytes are corrupted or lost, it’s possible to determine the start of the next UTF-8-encoded code point and resynchronize. It’s also unlikely that random 8-bit data will look like valid UTF-8.

python 2 - default encoding - ascii
python 3 - default encoding - unicode

Different encoding can be specified by placing the below line in the first line of script:
# -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-

print("\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA}")     # '\u0394' - Using the character name
print("\u0394")                             # '\u0394' - Using a 16-bit hex value
print("\U00000394")                         # '\u0394' - Using a 32-bit hex value

print(b'\x80abc'.decode("utf-8", "ignore"))             # 'abc'
