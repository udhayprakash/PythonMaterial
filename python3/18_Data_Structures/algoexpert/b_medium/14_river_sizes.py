Purpose: 
    https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/River%20Sizes
You are given a two-dimensional array(matrix)
of potentially unequal height and width containing only 
0s and 1s. Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents 
part of a river. A river consists of any number of 1s that 
are either horizontally or vertically adjacent 
(but not diagonally adjacent). 

The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determine its size. 
Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all 
rivers represented in the input matrix. Note that these sizes 
do not need to be in any particular order.
