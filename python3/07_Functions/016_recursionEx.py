Purpose: 


Three Laws of Recursion:
------------------------
1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.

pseudo-code:
-------------
def funcName(<input paramaters>):
    <some logic>
    return funcName(<input parameters>)


Recursion is a programming technique in which a call to a function results in another call to that same function.
Iteration is calling an object, and moving over it.

exercises on recursions:
--------------------------
1. Write a recursive function to compute the factorial of a number
        factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5, ..... 1
2. Write a recursive function to reverse a list
3. Write a recursive function to compute the fibonacci series
