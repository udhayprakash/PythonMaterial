Purpose: Working with comment operator
    - Once # is encountered, complete line from that position is ignored
    - PEP 8 recommends one white space after # operator
    - comments
        - Single Line comment  #
        - Multi-line comment - Python doesn't support

Question: Why python dont have multi-line comment operator
Answer  : Python is a interpreter based language. means each line executes separately

Python code --> line by line -> c code  -> asssembly -> Machine

ctrl + / - multi-line comment/uncomment

print('Hello world1')
"""

print("Hello world2")
# print('Hello world3')

# any operator within quotes with be treated as ordinary character
print("Hello #world4")
print("Hello", "world5", sep="#")

print("Hello world6")  # 123kj12312390809i*^&*(*(*&(*)))
print("Hello world7")  # This is about the world

print("Hello world7")  #
# print('Hello world8'#)
# SyntaxError: '(' was never closed
